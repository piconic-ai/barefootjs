Preserve source grouping when re-emitting binary expressions as infix template text. `(count() + 2) * 3` parses into an unambiguous `ParsedExpr` tree, but the EP/Jinja-family emitters joined operands textually (`l op r`), re-exposing the text to the target language's precedence — the SSR output silently computed `count + 2 * 3` (10 instead of 18) on Mojolicious, Text::Xslate, Twig, Jinja, Blade, and minijinja (ERB and Go already parenthesized). The grouping decision now lives in the shared layer as `groupBinaryOperand` (exported from `@barefootjs/jsx`): a compound operand (binary/logical/conditional) is parenthesized, leaf operands stay unwrapped so existing simple emissions are byte-identical. The `arithmetic-text` fixture graduates from those six adapters' `renderDivergences` declarations.

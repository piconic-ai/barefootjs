Normalize block-bodied `.filter()` predicates to a single boolean expression at IR-build time (#2040), retiring the per-adapter block-condition renderers.

A `filter(t => { … })` predicate is now folded with `foldBlockToExpr` (let-inline + early-return/`if` → ternary) and the boolean-context ternary is rewritten to `&&`/`||` via the new `predicateTernaryToLogical`, so it flows through the same expression-predicate path as `filter(t => !t.done)`. The IR's `filterPredicate.blockBody` field is removed — adapters only ever see `filterPredicate.predicate`.

`foldBlockToExpr` gains an optional `pureCallNames` oracle: an idempotent reactive getter read (`const f = filter()`) counts as pure, so a signal read on several branches still folds (the canonical TodoApp `active`/`completed`/`all` filter). `jsx-to-ir` supplies the analyzer's signal/memo names.

The Go / Mojolicious / Xslate adapters drop their now-dead `renderBlockBodyCondition` / `collectReturnPaths` / `buildSinglePathCondition` / `buildOrCondition` / `renderConditionsAnd` helpers; the shared expression-predicate renderer subsumes them. Render parity is unchanged (adapter conformance — Go + Perl — green; the boolean condition is truth-table-equivalent to the old OR-of-ANDs). Genuinely imperative filter blocks (loops, `break`, mutation) now refuse with BF021/BF101 instead of falling through.

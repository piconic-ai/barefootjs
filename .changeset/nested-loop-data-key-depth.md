Fix nested-loop `data-key` attributes to carry the depth suffix (`data-key-1`, `data-key-2`, ...) that the Hono/JS reference already emits for a `.map()` nested inside another `.map()`. Both the CSR client-JS path (`ir-to-client-js`'s `loopDepth` recursion counter) and the Hono SSR adapter (a `loopKeyStack`) already derived this independently at render time; the eight template (non-JS) adapters had no such mechanism at all and always emitted plain `data-key` regardless of nesting, so an inner loop's items were indistinguishable from the outer loop's for client-side reconciliation.

`IRLoop` gains a `depth` field (0 = outermost), computed once in Phase 1 (`jsx-to-ir.ts`, a `ctx.loopDepth` counter incremented/decremented in lockstep with `ctx.loopParams` around each `.map()` callback) — the single IR-computed source of truth every adapter now reads instead of re-deriving nesting depth on its own. Each of the eight adapters threads the loop's own `depth` through its `renderLoop`/`renderAttributes` call (a per-adapter save/restore field mirroring the existing `inLoop` boolean), so `key` → `data-key`/`data-key-N` matches `keyAttrName()` in `ir-to-client-js/utils.ts` exactly.

Also fixes a related, previously-undiscovered Jinja bug this fixture exposed: the adapter's member-access emitter lowered `obj.field` through Jinja's `.` (attribute-then-item) resolution, so a dict-shaped JS object with a field literally named `items`/`keys`/`values`/`get`/... resolved to Python's *built-in dict method* of the same name instead of the field's value (`group.items` → `TypeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object is not iterable`). Both Jinja member-access emitters now lower to bracket/item access (`obj['field']`, Jinja's `getitem`, key-first), which cannot collide with a dict method name.

`nested-loop-outer-binding` graduates from a render divergence to a passing render on all eight template adapters.

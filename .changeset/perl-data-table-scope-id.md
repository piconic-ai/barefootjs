Fix scope-ID divergence for body children of loop-item components (#1896). Both Perl adapters now reset `inLoop` before rendering body children in `renderComponent`, so nested components (e.g. `<TableCell>` inside a looped `<TableRow>`) receive `_bf_slot` for deterministic parent-scope-derived IDs matching Hono. Removes `data-table` from `skipJsx` in both adapter conformance tests.

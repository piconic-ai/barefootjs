Fix #2273: refuse a method call on a prop typed as a built-in host rich type (`Date`, `Map`, `Set`, `URL`, …) with no catalogued lowering, instead of silently transliterating it into template syntax that dies at request time.

`Date` props (and the other host rich types) previously lowered as an opaque passthrough: `createdAt.toISOString()` compiled cleanly and rendered correctly on Hono/CSR, but on the SSR text-template adapters transliterated verbatim into the target syntax (a Go template method-value panic, a Jinja `AttributeError`, …) — a failure only visible once someone actually rendered the page. `checkRichTypeMethodCalls` (`packages/jsx/src/rich-type-refusal.ts`) closes that gap at compile time: it walks every expression position the compiler already lowers into a template and refuses with BF021 as soon as a call's receiver is provably a host rich type (`Date`, `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`, `WeakSet`, `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `RegExp`, `Promise`, `Error`, `Symbol`, `BigInt`, `Function`) with no catalogued lowering. Verified against the full 2500+-unit `packages/jsx` suite and the `ui/components` corpus with zero false positives — the refusal only fires when `rich-type-evidence.ts`'s type resolution can *prove* the receiver's type from `propsType`/`typeDefinitions`; any receiver it can't prove a type for (signal getter results, untyped/generic receivers, computed access, …) is silently allowed through, matching the existing BF021 filter/sort-comparator refusal's conservative-by-construction design.

Two exemptions keep the escape hatches intact:

- `/* @client */` opts the expression out of SSR lowering, same as every other BF021 shape.
- A call a registered lowering plugin claims (`lowering-registry.ts`, #2057) is exempt — cataloguing an individual rich-type API (e.g. `Date.prototype.toISOString`) is a plugin's job, not a change to this refusal. That catalogue is tracked separately as #2274.

All nine adapters' `conformance-pins.ts` now pin the new `date-method-uncatalogued` fixture to `{ code: 'BF021', severity: 'error' }` — including Hono, since the refusal runs ahead of `adapter.generate()` and applies even to adapters whose own runtime could otherwise evaluate the call.

Decode JSX character references in Phase 1 and escape static content on emit. JSX defines `&copy;` in literal text (and in quoted attribute values) as the character `©` — Babel, esbuild, and TypeScript's JSX emit all decode at parse time — but the compiler carried the RAW source text through the IR, so every template adapter re-emitted the undecoded entity (`html-entity-text` divergence) and none escaped HTML metacharacters in static attribute values (`static-attr-escape`: `title="Fish & Chips"` reached the output unescaped). Phase 1 now decodes via the new `decodeEntities` (`@barefootjs/shared`; numeric references fully, named references from a curated table — unknown names degrade consistently on every backend), so `IRText.value` and static attribute values carry the semantics. Emission escapes per context: the eight template adapters and the client-JS `innerHTML` template builders route static text and attribute values through the shared `escapeHtml` (`& < > "`), and the Hono adapter re-encodes for JSX source (adding `{`/`}`). Both fixtures graduate from all eight adapters' `renderDivergences` declarations and from the CSR conformance skip list.

Fix dropped component props in CSR render. A parent passing a non-statically-inlinable value (e.g. `Array.from(...)` or an init-scope local) as a prop to a child component emitted `renderChild('Child', {})` — silently dropping the prop — so the child's template read it eagerly and threw (`Cannot read properties of undefined`). Such children now defer to a placeholder + `upsertChild` (`createComponent` with the complete getter props), mirroring the existing clientOnly-conditional / loop-placeholder paths. SSR adapters are unaffected.

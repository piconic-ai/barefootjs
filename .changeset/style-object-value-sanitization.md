Fix #2261: dynamic `style={{ … }}` object-literal values that could break out of a CSS declaration now match Hono's oracle behavior — the unsafe `key:value` pair is dropped entirely — instead of being kept (merely HTML-escaped) as every non-Hono adapter previously did.

Hono's own `hasUnsafeStyleValue` guard (`hono/jsx/utils.ts`) is a hand-rolled structural scan for characters that could escape a CSS declaration (unbalanced quotes/brackets, bare `;`/`{`/`}`, unterminated comments) — NOT real CSSOM property validation. It is the contract every adapter's SSR output must match byte-for-byte.

Each adapter gains a single `style_object`/`bf_style_object`/`StyleObjectToCSS` runtime helper (ported byte-for-byte from Hono's scan) that builds the whole CSS string at once: unsafe pairs are omitted, safe values are still HTML-escaped afterward (a structurally "safe" value can still carry a literal `"`/`'`/`&`). `tryLowerStyleObject` in each adapter now emits a single call to this helper instead of per-pair string interpolation.

- Go: `hasUnsafeStyleValue` + `StyleObjectToCSS` in `bf.go`, registered as `bf_style_object`.
- ERB/Rust/Jinja/Twig/Blade/Xslate/Mojolicious: analogous `style_object` runtime methods (Rust and PHP and Perl runtimes are each shared across two adapters — minijinja, Twig+Blade, and Xslate+Mojolicious respectively).

Removes the `style-object-dynamic:gen:color:markup` `skipDataPoints` pin from all eight adapters' conformance tests.

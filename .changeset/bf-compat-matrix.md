`@barefootjs/jsx` exports `ConformancePin` / `ConformancePins` types, and each adapter package now exports its conformance `expectedDiagnostics` pin set as a structured `conformancePins` module (with `issue:` URLs) consumed by its own conformance test. These structured pins also feed a repo-internal component × adapter compile-compatibility matrix (`ui/compat.lock.json`, regenerated with `bun run compat:lock` and drift-checked in CI) that is not part of the published CLI or any published package's runtime surface.

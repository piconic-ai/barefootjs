Variable element-access + `.toFixed`, and `/* @client */`-guarded memo SSR folding (#1897, data-table):

- `@barefootjs/jsx`: new `index-access` `ParsedExpr` kind for element access with a non-literal index (`selected()[index]`, `rows[i + 1]`). Previously refused as "Complex computed property access"; now supported and dispatched through a new `ParsedExprEmitter.indexAccess` arm. The Perl adapters disambiguate array (`->[$i]`) from hash (`->{$k}`) deref by the index's type; Xslate/Hono use the language's polymorphic `[]`; Go emits the `index` builtin.
- `@barefootjs/jsx`: `.toFixed(digits?)` lowers as a new `array-method` across all adapters — `bf->to_fixed` / `$bf.to_fixed` (new Perl runtime helper), `bf_to_fixed` (new Go runtime helper, `fmt.Sprintf("%.*f", …)`), native `.toFixed` on Hono.
- `@barefootjs/jsx`: `extractSsrDefaults` now folds a block-body memo through a statically-resolvable `if (cond) return …` guard, so a `/* @client */`-guarded memo (`const key = sortKey(); if (!key) return rows; … sort …`) seeds its default-state early-return value instead of `null`.
- `@barefootjs/mojolicious`: the test harness seeds a root signal whose initial is `null` / unevaluable as `undef` (rather than skipping it), so a getter read only in a child-prop expression doesn't fault strict vars.

With these, the composed `data-table` demo compiles clean on both Perl adapters and renders structurally byte-identical to Hono on real Mojolicious / Text::Xslate. It stays pinned in `skipJsx` on a single remaining divergence — the scope-ID of imported components inside the keyed `.map` (a hydration-scope concern tracked with #1896), not an expression-lowering gap.

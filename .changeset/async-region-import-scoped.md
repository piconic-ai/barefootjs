`<Async>` and `<Region>` are now **import-scoped, import-required** built-ins instead of bare capitalized tag-name matches (#1915, follow-up to #1914).

The compiler recognises them only when their local binding is imported from `@barefootjs/client` (keyed off `ir.metadata.imports`), so a user's own `<Async>` / `<Region>` component — imported from elsewhere or declared locally — no longer collides with the built-in, and an aliased `import { Async as Boundary }` maps `<Boundary>` through. Real, type-checked `Async` / `Region` stubs now ship from `@barefootjs/client` (they throw if ever executed, since the compiler compiles the tags away), giving authors prop-checking and completion — the model `Portal` already follows, and how Solid imports `<Show>` / `<Suspense>` from `solid-js`. The import is elided on emit (both `templateImports` and the client-JS DOM imports) so it never survives as a phantom runtime import.

A bare `<Async>` / `<Region>` used without the import and with no other in-scope binding now raises `BF054`. This replaces the per-file `declare function Async(...)` workaround and the `@barefootjs/hono` JSX runtime's `export declare function Async` (removed).

**Migration:** add `import { Async, Region } from '@barefootjs/client'` to files that use these tags.

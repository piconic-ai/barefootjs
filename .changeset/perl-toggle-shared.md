Graduate the `toggle-shared` conformance fixture to Hono parity on the Mojolicious and Text::Xslate adapters — a keyed `.map` of sibling `ToggleItem` children, each with a per-item prop-derived signal. Three gaps were closed (#1297):

1. **Prop-derived signal SSR seeding.** A signal whose init derives from a prop (`createSignal(props.defaultOn ?? false)`) is now seeded in-template from the passed prop (`% my $on = ($defaultOn // 0);` / `: my $on = ($defaultOn // 0);`), so a loop child honours its own per-item prop instead of the static default. The lowering is gated by `isSupported` (object/array/constant inits never reach `convertExpression*`, so they don't record a spurious BF101 and keep their existing ssr-defaults seeding) and skipped on Text::Xslate for a same-name signal (Kolon can't express `: my $x = … $x …`; those stay on the harness/manifest seeding, which already resolves them from the prop).

2. **Loop-child scope id.** A loop child now gets a fresh `<ComponentName>_<rand>` scope id (the PascalCase component name) instead of a parent-slot id, matching the Hono reference (`normalizeHTML` canonicalises `<ComponentName>_<rand>` → `<ComponentName>_*`).

3. **`data-key`.** The JSX `key` (a reserved prop) now lands as `data-key="…"` on the child scope root, for keyed-loop reconciliation parity. `BarefootJS.pm` gains a `_data_key` field + `data_key_attr` helper; `render_child` sets it from the `key` prop; the component root emits it (`bf->data_key_attr` / `$bf.data_key_attr()`), so non-keyed renders add nothing.

Note: prop-derived signals/memos are now computed in-template from the props they derive from, so a host seeds the *prop* (e.g. `initial`) rather than the signal value directly. Verified end-to-end against real Mojolicious and Text::Xslate. Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

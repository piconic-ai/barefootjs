Normalize intrinsic-element attribute names ONCE in Phase 1: `IRAttribute.name` now carries the HTML/SVG attribute name, so every adapter emits it verbatim. The shared `dom-prop` classifier grows an `HTML_CAMEL_ALIASES` table (React-style camelCase → HTML: `tabIndex` → `tabindex`, `maxLength` → `maxlength`, `autoComplete` → `autocomplete`, `readOnly` → the boolean `readonly`, `spellCheck` → the enumerated `spellcheck`, …) consulted by both `toHTMLAttrName` (now applied in `jsx-to-ir`'s `processAttributes`) and `toHTMLAttrNameRuntime` (spread paths). Previously each adapter mapped at most `className` → `class` itself and every other alias leaked into the emitted HTML as an unknown attribute the browser ignores — `htmlFor` never became `for` (broken label association on template backends), `readOnly` rendered as `readOnly="true"` vs bare presence depending on backend, and SVG `strokeWidth`/`strokeLinecap` passed through unmapped. Component props (`IRProp`) keep the user's API names; unknown names (`data-*`, custom-element attributes, `viewBox`-style case-sensitive SVG XML names) pass through unchanged. The `camelcase-attributes`, `svg-icon`, and `boolean-attr-literals` fixtures graduate from every adapter's `renderDivergences` declaration and the CSR skip list.

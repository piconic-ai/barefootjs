Lower conditional inline-object spreads on intrinsic elements. A spread of the shape `{...(cond ? { 'aria-describedby': value } : {})}` (either branch possibly `{}`) now compiles on both template adapters instead of raising `BF101`.

The Go adapter builds the spread bag as an immediately-invoked `func() map[string]any { ... }()` in `NewXxxProps` that conditionally returns the populated map or an empty one. The Mojo adapter emits an equivalent Perl inline ternary of hashrefs (`$cond ? { 'aria-describedby' => $value } : {}`) through `bf->spread_attrs`. In both adapters the falsy branch yields an empty bag so the key is omitted rather than rendered as an empty-string attribute (neither `SpreadAttrs` nor `bf->spread_attrs` filters empty strings).

The condition supports a bare prop identifier and its negation; object keys must be static string/identifier names and values resolve prop references (`in.Field` / `$prop`) or string literals. Any other shape still falls through to the existing `BF101` refusal.

Additionally, both adapters now honour Hono-style nullish-attribute omission for dynamic attributes. When an attribute value is a bare reference to a nillable prop (Go: a field whose resolved type is `interface{}`; Mojo: a prop with no destructure default and a non-primitive type), the attribute is guarded so an unset value drops the attribute entirely instead of rendering `attr=""`. Go emits `{{if ne .Rows nil}}rows="{{.Rows}}"{{end}}`; Mojo emits `<% if (defined $rows) { %>rows="<%= $rows %>"<% } %>`. Concrete-typed (`string`/`int`/`bool`) and defaulted props are unaffected and still emit unconditionally (matching Hono's `value=""` / `data-count="0"`). This unblocks the `textarea` fixture's optional `rows?: number` prop on both adapter conformance suites.

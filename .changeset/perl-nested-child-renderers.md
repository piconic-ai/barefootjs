Nested `render_child` calls now resolve and carry correct slot identity. Two fixes (#1897):

- A child template rendering another imported component (AccordionTrigger → ChevronDownIcon) executed against a fresh `BarefootJS` instance whose child-renderer registry started empty — the registry is now shared with each child instance (test harnesses + `register_components_from_manifest`).
- `render_child` now invokes the renderer as `$renderer->($props, $invoking_bf)`, and renderer closures derive the child's scope/slot identity from the caller's scope id instead of the registrant's. A grandchild now mounts as `root_s0_s0` rather than collapsing to `root_s0` and colliding `(host, slot)` pairs (#1249 slot-identity contract). Renderer contract note: unpack `@_` (`my ($props, $caller) = @_;`) — a one-argument subroutine signature (`sub ($props)`) enforces arity and will die on the second argument.

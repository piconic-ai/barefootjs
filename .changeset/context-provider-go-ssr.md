Implement SSR context propagation for the Go template adapter, bringing the `context-provider` conformance fixture to parity with the Hono reference (the Perl backends stay deferred).

Template engines have no JS runtime context stack like the Hono adapter's `provideContextSSR`, so a `useContext` value has to be threaded in at the data-construction layer:

- **`collectContextConsumers` (`@barefootjs/jsx`)** — a shared helper that, for a component, finds every `const x = useContext(Ctx)` consumer and resolves each `Ctx` to its `createContext(<default>)` default value (string / number / boolean literal). Single source of truth for the SSR-context adapters.

- **Go consumer side** — each `useContext` consumer becomes a struct field on the component's `Input` / `Props` (named after the local binding, e.g. `theme` → `Theme`), defaulted in `NewXxxProps` to the `createContext` default when the caller doesn't set it. The template already lowers the `useContext` local to a `{{.Theme}}` root-field read; it now resolves against a real field instead of emitting `.Theme` against a struct that has none (the prior compile failure).

- **Go provider side** — `collectStaticChildInstances` threads the active `<Ctx.Provider value>` bindings (literal values lowered to Go literals) down the IR tree. When a static child slot consumes a context an enclosing provider supplies, its `NewXxxProps(...Input{ ... })` construction sets the matching field to the provider value (cross-component consumer lookup via the existing `registerChildComponentShape` channel), so `useContext(Ctx)` resolves to the provided value at template-eval time.

`context-provider` is unskipped on the Go conformance suite. It stays skipped on the Mojolicious / Xslate suites (their stash-seed render path would port the same way — tracked as a follow-up); their skip rationales are updated to reflect that the Go path now exists. Hono reference snapshots are unchanged.

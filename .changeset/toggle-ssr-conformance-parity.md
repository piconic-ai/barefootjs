Bring the `toggle` site/ui primitive to SSR conformance parity across the Go, Mojolicious, and Xslate template adapters.

`toggle`'s `classes` is a block-bodied `createMemo` that indexes module-scope `Record<T, string>` maps by a memo-local key with a default: `const variant = props.variant ?? 'default'; … ${variantClasses[variant]} ${sizeClasses[size]} …`. Lowering it to an SSR value required three extensions:

- **`parseRecordIndexAccess` (`@barefootjs/jsx`)** gains an optional key resolver so the index key can be a memo-local const (resolved to its underlying prop + `?? '<lit>'` default), not only a bare prop. The result now carries that `defaultKey`. The resolver takes precedence over the same-named prop, since only the local binding carries the fallback.

- **Go adapter** template-literal memo path now handles block-bodied arrows (collecting leading `const X = props.Y ?? 'lit'` key bindings, then resolving the single returned template literal) and emits `recordConst[key]` as an inline `map[string]string{…}[fmt.Sprint(in.Field)]`. When the key has a `'default'` fallback, the map also maps the empty key `""` to that default entry's value, so an unset prop (Go zero value `""`) renders the default instead of an empty string — matching Hono's `props.X ?? 'default'` runtime evaluation. `inferMemoType` recognises a template-literal memo as `string` (so the class-string `/` in `ring-ring/50` no longer trips the arithmetic-int heuristic).

- **`extractSsrDefaults` (`@barefootjs/jsx`)**, the Mojo / Xslate SSR stash seed, now statically evaluates block-bodied arrows (leading `const` declarations into a local scope, then the `return` expression) and indexes a resolved object / array with a resolved scalar key, so the seeded `classes` is a concrete string. The Xslate adapter consumes this through the same SSR-seed path as Mojo.

Also adds an HTML character-reference canonicalisation to the shared `normalizeHTML` conformance helper: a literal `"` in an attribute value (the `[class*="size-"]` in `toggle`'s base classes) is escaped as the named `&quot;` by Hono but as the numeric `&#34;` by Go's `html/template`. Both decode to the same character, so the interchangeable numeric (decimal + hex) forms are now collapsed to one canonical named form on both sides of the comparison — adapter-neutral, same motivation as the existing boolean-attribute / void-element canonicalisation.

`toggle` is unskipped on all three adapter conformance suites. Hono reference snapshots are unchanged.

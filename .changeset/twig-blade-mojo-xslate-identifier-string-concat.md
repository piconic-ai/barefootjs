Fix #2212: `a + b` where BOTH operands are bare identifiers (destructured string props, or same-file string `const`s) — not a string literal, template literal, zero-arg getter, or `props.x` member — now correctly lowers to Twig's `~`, Blade's `.`, Mojolicious's `.`, or Xslate's `~` concat operator instead of falling through to native numeric `+`, which fatals at PHP render time and silently coerces to `0` at Perl render time. Residual of #2163/#2176: `isStringTypedOperand` (`@barefootjs/jsx`) had no `identifier` arm, so a component's own destructured string props (`{ first, last }: { first: string; last: string }`) and same-file string consts were never recognized even though `isStringConcatBinary` already existed to route them correctly. Jinja/minijinja and ERB are unaffected — their native `+`/string interpolation already concatenates strings correctly without any static compile-time decision, so this issue's original "Twig, Blade only" scope is corrected to include Mojolicious and Xslate (Perl's `+`, like PHP's, is numeric-only).

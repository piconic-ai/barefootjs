Fix #2272: graduate the remaining catalogue pins on Blade, Twig, Xslate, and Mojolicious.

- **#2260** (controlled/derived boolean SSR seeds) — Blade and Twig (PHP) and Xslate and Mojolicious (Perl, via the shared `BarefootJS.pm` runtime) already picked up the shared-layer `freeIdentifiers()` fix from the original #2260 landing; their `toggle`/`switch`/`checkbox` `skipDataPoints` pins were simply never removed. Verified against real conformance runs — no code changes needed for this part.
- **#2261** (dynamic style value sanitization) — Xslate's `style-object-dynamic` pin was likewise a leftover: the adapter and shared Perl runtime were already fixed when #2261 landed across all 8 adapters, but this one pin was missed.
- **#2262** (`.flat(dynamicDepth)` stringification) — Mojolicious's `.join()` lowering called Perl's native `join()` builtin directly on the dereferenced array, bypassing the shared runtime's `join` method entirely; a nested-array element (e.g. `.flat(0)`'s shallow copy) stringified to its Perl memory address (`ARRAY(0x...)`) instead of JS's recursive comma-join. Now routes through `bf->join(...)`, matching Xslate's existing `$bf.join(...)` routing. The shared Perl runtime's own `string()`/`join()` methods also gained the same recursive-array-stringification fix Go/ERB already had (`.flat`'s shallow copy stringified via `Array.prototype.toString`'s `join(',')` semantics, applied recursively), since neither previously handled a nested ARRAY-ref element at all.

Removes every remaining `toggle:gen:pressed:true` / `switch:gen:checked:true` / `checkbox:gen:checked:true` / `style-object-dynamic:gen:color:markup` / `array-flat-dynamic-depth:gen:depth:zero` / `array-flat-dynamic-depth:gen:depth:negative` pin across the four adapters — all four `skipDataPoints` sets are now empty.

SSR-compute memos derived from the `createSearchParams()` env signal (#2075), building on the #1922 per-request readers — including LIST-valued filter memos on Go. Env-signal handling is now open-closed: a new `ENV_SIGNAL_READERS` registry in `@barefootjs/jsx` (`envSignalReaderFor` / `envSignalLocalNames`) supplies the canonical reader name and method set, so a future env signal registers once instead of growing per-adapter branches. Mojo/Xslate seed derived memos in-template from the registry-resolved canonical reader (aliased getters canonicalise), with the seed-availability check allowing lowering-internal bindings (arrow/lambda params, Perl's `$_`, Kolon's `$bf`). Go lowers scalar derived memos (`get('k')` bare and `?? '<lit>'` defaulted) and list-filter memos (`props.items.filter(p => …tag()…)` → `bf.FilterEval` with the predicate's getter calls materialized into the env) in the generated constructor, typing filter memos `[]any`. The runtime evaluator gains its first `array-method` — `.includes` (array SameValueZero membership / string substring) — implemented isomorphically in Go and Perl and pinned by new golden vectors; `.every`/`.some` predicates using `.includes` now route through the evaluator on the Perl adapters too. The pre-existing template-position helpers (`bf_includes`, `$bf->includes`) now share the same SameValueZero equality — previously Go used `reflect.DeepEqual` (int/float64 never matched, `[NaN].includes(NaN)` was false) and Perl used stringy `eq` (`[2].includes("2")` was wrongly true) — so `.includes` returns the JS answer regardless of position.

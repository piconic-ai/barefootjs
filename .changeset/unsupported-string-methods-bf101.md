Raise BF101 at build time for unsupported `String.prototype` methods on the template-language adapters (#1448 follow-up).

Methods that have no SSR lowering — `split`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `replace`, `replaceAll`, `repeat`, `padStart`, `padEnd`, `charAt`, `charCodeAt`, `codePointAt`, `normalize`, `substring`, `substr`, `match`, `matchAll`, `search` — were previously absent from the `UNSUPPORTED_METHODS` gate, so `isSupported` reported them supported and the Go / Mojolicious adapters emitted an invalid raw method call (`{{.Name.StartsWith "a"}}` / `$name->{startsWith}('a')`) that produced no build diagnostic and only crashed at template-render time.

They now surface BF101 with an actionable `/* @client */` suggestion (parity with the unsupported array methods), and the adapter degrades to a safe empty slot instead of emitting template that fails at render. The Mojo adapter routes these through the AST path so the shared `isSupported` gate fires rather than the regex pipeline mangling them. The `/* @client */` escape hatch continues to work for any of these expressions.

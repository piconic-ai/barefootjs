Compute prop/signal-derived memos at SSR time on the Mojolicious and Text::Xslate adapters, graduating the `props-reactivity-comparison` conformance fixture to Hono parity.

A memo whose body isn't statically foldable — e.g. `createMemo(() => props.value * 10)` — gets a `null` static SSR default from `extractSsrDefaults` (a bare prop access resolves to `undefined`). The Perl SSR model seeds child memos from those static defaults, so `$displayValue` was never declared and the child rendered empty (Go matches Hono because it generates a child constructor that computes the memo from the passed prop; the Perl static path had no equivalent — the reason both adapters skipped the fixture).

Each adapter now seeds such memos in-template from the already-seeded prop/signal vars:

- **Mojo**: `% my $displayValue = $value * 10;`
- **Xslate**: `: my $displayValue = $value * 10;`

The seed is emitted only when the memo's static default is `null` (statically-foldable memos stay on the existing ssr-defaults path) and when every variable the lowered expression references is already in scope (props params + signals + prior memos), so a memo over an out-of-scope binding stays on the null path rather than tripping Perl strict mode. Verified end-to-end against real Mojolicious and Text::Xslate. Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

Compile JSX used as an object-literal arrow value and render dynamic dispatch (#1663).

A `Record<K, () => JSX>` lookup map (`{ piconic: () => <BrandLogo/> }`) was never lowered: a module-level map had its const dropped from the emitted module (`ReferenceError` at SSR), and a function-local map leaked raw `<...>` into the client bundle (`SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'`). The preprocessor now hoists arrow values in object-literal property assignments into synthesized components, the same lowering already applied to arrows in JSX-attribute position, so the lookup map survives as component references.

Dynamic dispatch of such a map in child position (`<div>{themeLogo(props.id)}</div>`) now renders on the client: the dynamic-text effect routes through a new `__bfText` runtime helper that splices the live component element into the slot by identity instead of stringifying it to `"[object HTMLElement]"`. Adapters and `createComponent` default missing props to `{}` so a bare no-arg shim call (`LOGOS[id]()`) no longer crashes destructuring `undefined`.

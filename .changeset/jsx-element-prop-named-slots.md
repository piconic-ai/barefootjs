Support a JSX element passed as a non-`children` prop (`<Card header={<strong>Title</strong>}>`, the slot / render-prop-lite pattern) on all 8 template adapters. Every adapter already had a mechanism to forward the reserved `children` slot from a parent template into a child render (a captured buffer slice, a `{% set %}` block, a Kolon macro, a Go struct field, ...); named JSX-valued props reuse that exact same mechanism, keyed by the prop's own name instead of `children`, rather than inventing a new shared capture path.

- **Go**: bakes the value the same way real children are baked (`extractTextChildren` / `extractHtmlChildren`, falling back to `extractScopedHtmlChildren` when the root needs the parent's runtime scope id) and emits it as its own struct field.
- **Jinja / Twig / Rust (minijinja)**: a `{% set captureName %}...{% endset %}` block per named slot, passed as a dict/hash entry.
- **Text::Xslate**: a Kolon `macro NAME -> () { ... }` per named slot, called immediately in the hash literal.
- **Blade**: a PHP output-buffering capture (`ob_start()` / `ob_get_clean()`), wrapped in `$bf->backend->mark_raw(...)` so the child's `{{ }}` doesn't re-escape it.
- **Mojolicious / Text::Xslate (Perl)**: a `begin %>...<% end` capture (Mojo) / immediate macro call (Xslate) passed into `render_child`'s named-arg list. The shared `BarefootJS.pm` runtime's `render_child` now materializes *every* prop value (previously only the reserved `children` key) — a no-op for any value that isn't a captured CODE ref, so this generalizes safely to both backends.
- **ERB**: the same output-buffer-slice capture already used for `children`, but ERB's `<%=` (unlike every other adapter's template tag) has no built-in "safe string" wrapper it can bypass escaping on for a read-back, so the runtime gains one: a new `BarefootJS::SafeString` marker class, returned by `Backend::Erb#mark_raw` (previously an identity no-op) and recognized by `Context#h` to skip re-escaping already-finished HTML forwarded across a parent/child template boundary.

`jsx-element-prop` graduates from a render divergence to a passing render on all 8 template adapters.

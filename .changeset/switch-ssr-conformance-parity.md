Bring the `switch` site/ui primitive to SSR conformance parity across the Go, Mojolicious, and Xslate template adapters.

`switch` assembles its track/thumb classes in function-scope plain consts (`trackClasses`, `thumbClasses`) rather than a `Record`-indexed memo, so it needs no `Record` SSR lowering — only two gaps blocked cross-adapter parity:

- **Function-scope const prop enumeration.** `augmentInheritedPropAccesses` (`@barefootjs/jsx`) previously scanned memos, signals, init statements, effects, and template attributes for inherited `props.X` reads, but not function-scope const initializers. The `props.className` read inside `const trackClasses = \`… ${props.className ?? ''}\`` was therefore never enumerated, so the generated struct/stash had no field to bind a caller's `className` to. It now also scans non-module local consts (module consts can't reference the function-scoped `props`, so they're skipped).

- **`[...].join(' ')` module-const inlining on the Perl adapters.** Module consts assembled as `const stateClasses = ['[&[data-state=…]]:…', …].join(' ')` were emitted as references (`$trackStateClasses`) to bindings that don't exist server-side. A new shared `evalStringArrayJoin` helper statically evaluates the join and inlines the flattened string byte-for-byte, matching the Hono reference and the Go adapter's existing private behaviour. Wired into the Mojolicious and Xslate `parsePureStringLiteral` module-const collectors.

`switch` is unskipped on all three adapter conformance suites. Hono reference snapshots are unchanged.

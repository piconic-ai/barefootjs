Fix #2208: a `.map()` loop source that is a fully-static array/object literal — either inline (`[{ label: 'Alpha' }, ...].map(...)`) or a function-scope local `const` with no prop/signal/function-call dependency in its initializer — no longer refuses with BF101 on any of the 8 non-Hono template adapters.

`@barefootjs/jsx` adds `evaluateStaticLiteral`/`resolveStaticLoopSource` (`static-literal.ts`), a shared compile-time evaluator for a `ParsedExpr` that resolves to a fully compile-time-known JS value. The 7 template-string adapters (Jinja, minijinja/Rust, Twig, Blade, ERB, Mojolicious, Xslate) each serialize the resolved value into their own native array/object literal syntax and inline it directly in the loop header, the same way a module-scope const's value is already seeded. A runtime-computed local (`Object.entries(props.tags).filter(...)`, #2069) is unaffected and still refuses.

Go template additionally bakes each item's child-component props and `data-key` directly into the generated `New<Name>Props` constructor when the loop body is a single child component with a plain-value prop set (`analyzeBakeableStaticChildLoop`), since Go's `{{range .ListItems}}` template already exists for that shape and only needed the constructor data. A plain-element loop body (no child component) is out of scope for this fix on Go — see the follow-up issue for that narrower gap.

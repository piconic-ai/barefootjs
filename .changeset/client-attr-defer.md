Honor `/* @client */` on attribute bindings (#1966).

The inline directive deferred a JSX child/text expression to hydration but was silently ignored on attribute initializers: a Go-unsupported predicate in `data-x={/* @client */ pred(x)}` still got lowered and raised BF101/BF102, making the BF102 remediation misleading for attribute-only reactive state.

The `clientOnly` flag was already set in the IR and honored by the client-JS reactive-attribute path (the CSR template omits the attribute and a mount effect sets/patches it on hydrate). The gap was in the adapters: `renderAttributes` lowered every attribute. All four adapters (Go, Mojo, Xslate, Hono) now skip SSR emission for `clientOnly` attributes, so the server omits the attribute, the unsupported-expression lowering is never reached, and the client sets it on hydrate.

/**
 * Fixtures that compile clean on this adapter but render divergent from the

// #2696 graduated: `todo-app` / `todo-app-ssr` seeded `todos` opaque
// because their `.map(t => ({ ...t, editing: false }))` callback body's
// object-literal SPREAD refused (`checkSupport`). Step 2 admits a spread
// at value position and the runtime evaluator's `object-literal` case
// now merges it, so the seed classifies `derived` and SSRs identically
// to Hono.
// #2679 graduated (capture-before-shadow in `generateDerivedMemoSeed`,
// packages/adapter-xslate/src/adapter/memo/seed.ts): a self-referencing
// derived signal/memo now seeds a throwaway `__bf_seed_<name>` local from
// the RAW-stash-var Kolon lowering BEFORE `$<name>` is declared, then binds
// the real name off that capture — the same in-template recompute the other
// six template-stash backends already had. Keep the file even when the set
// is empty — the next divergence lands here, not in a re-created file.
// #2943 graduated: a BODY-destructured prop's default now reaches
// `ParamInfo.defaultValue` directly (the analyzer overlays it onto
// `propsParams` at the binding's own declaration), so `extractSsrDefaults`
// seeds the evaluated default and the adapter's nullable-optional
// classification no longer treats the prop as defaultless — `data-label`
// now renders `'none'` here exactly like Hono, both for a plain default
// and a renamed one.

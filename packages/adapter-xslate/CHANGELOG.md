### Minor Changes

- 166177d: Composed `site/ui` demo-corpus parity for the perl adapters (#1897):

  - **Xslate now renders the ENTIRE shared conformance corpus to Hono parity** (`skipJsx` is empty). `tabs` / `accordion` / `pagination` came off via: ARIA `aria-selected`/`aria-expanded` and boolean-TYPED prop routing through `bool_str`, compile-time resolution of module object-literal const property access (`variantClasses.ghost`), composed template-literal module consts, `attr={cond ? v : undefined}` attribute omission, and literal-const inlining (`totalPages`).
  - **Mojolicious closes the strict-vars seeding gap**: child renders now seed declared props (JSX default or `undef`), inherited `props.<x>` accesses (via the shared augmentation pass), signal initials, and memo `ssrDefaults` under the caller's props — `tabs` / `tooltip` / `pagination` render to parity and `skipJsx` is empty. The remaining composed fixtures stay pinned on the context-provider object-literal lowering (BF101), the tracked #1897 feature.
  - `@barefootjs/jsx` exports the shared static-const machinery all three SSR adapters now use: `collectModuleStringConsts` (fixed-point, incl. composed template-literal consts and `[...].join(sep)`) and `lookupStaticRecordLiteral` (module object-literal property/index lookup). The Go adapter delegates to it (no behavior change).

- 8d2cbe8: `searchParams()` (router v0.5) now renders at SSR on the Mojolicious and Xslate template adapters, so the cross-adapter `search-params` conformance fixture (`{searchParams().get('sort') ?? 'none'}`) runs on Perl too instead of being skipped (#1922, follow-up to the Go support).

  - **Lowering** (`@barefootjs/jsx` shared helpers `importsSearchParams` / `matchSearchParamsMethodCall`, consumed by both Perl adapters): `searchParams().get(k)` is recognised as an env-signal method call and lowered to a real method call on the per-request reader — `$searchParams->get('sort')` (Mojo) / `$searchParams.get('sort')` (Xslate) — instead of the broken generic deref (`$searchParams->{get}` / `$searchParams.get`, which dropped the call + argument). Scoped to components that import `searchParams` from `@barefootjs/client`.
  - **Runtime** (`@barefootjs/perl`): new `BarefootJS::SearchParams` — a core-Perl, framework-agnostic reader. `new($query)` parses an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` query (leading `?`, `+`/`%XX` decoding tolerated); `get($key)` returns the first value, or `undef` when absent. Because the adapters lower `??` to Perl's defined-or `//` (which coalesces only `undef`), this matches JS `??` exactly — an absent key falls back to the author's default while a present-but-empty value (`?sort=`) keeps the empty string (a closer match than the Go adapter, whose `or` lowering also coalesces `''`).
  - **Mojolicious wiring** (`@barefootjs/mojolicious`): the plugin's `before_render` hook seeds the `$searchParams` template var per request from `$c->req->query_params`, so `searchParams()` resolves the live query during SSR (the client re-reads `window.location` on hydration). A caller-set value wins (`//=`).
  - **Xslate**: the backend is framework-agnostic, so the host passes a `searchParams => BarefootJS::SearchParams->new($query)` template var (the conformance harness seeds an empty-query reader; production hosts thread their request query).

- 77974ee: Context-provider object-literal lowering for the Perl adapters (#1897):

  - `@barefootjs/jsx` exports `parseProviderObjectLiteral`, a structural (TS AST) classifier for `<Ctx.Provider value={{ … }}>` members: zero-param expression-body arrows are getters (SSR snapshot of the body), other function shapes are client-only behavior, everything else is a plain expression.
  - The Mojolicious and Xslate adapters lower object-literal provider values to Perl/Kolon hashrefs instead of refusing with BF101: getter members snapshot their body's SSR value, handler (`on[A-Z]`) and function-shaped members lower to `undef`/`nil`. Keys keep their JS names so consumer-side accesses map onto the same hashref keys.
  - `ref={fn}` props on imported components are skipped at SSR like `on*` handlers (Hono renders neither; client JS wires them at hydration).

  This un-pins the composed `site/ui` demo fixtures that were BF101-blocked on their context providers (`radio-group`, `accordion`, `dialog`, `popover`, `select`, `dropdown-menu`, `combobox`, `command`).

- 071a1a3: `<Region>` now lowers to a `bf-region` page-lifecycle boundary (spec/router.md), the smallest end-to-end proof for the router RFC's compiler-derived nested regions. Following the `<Async>` built-in precedent, the compiler recognises `<Region>` (and its self-closing form) by tag name and lowers it to a wrapper `<div>` carrying a deterministic `bf-region="<file scope>:<index>"` id — the `computeFileScope` FNV hash of the source path plus a per-file structural index. Because a layout compiles to one shared partial, every page composing it emits the _same_ id, which is what a client router matches a region on across page documents.

  The id is a static string, so all four adapters (Hono, Go template, Mojolicious, Xslate) emit byte-identical `bf-region="<id>"` markers — no per-adapter template interpolation. Covered by a cross-adapter conformance fixture (`region-boundary`) in addition to the Hono-only emit assertion in `packages/jsx`.

  Recognition is by capitalized tag name; import-scoped disambiguation, a runtime `<Region>` export, nested/sibling runtime diffing, and the scope-ownership dispose/rehydrate path are follow-ups.

- 6547370: Variable element-access + `.toFixed`, and `/* @client */`-guarded memo SSR folding (#1897, data-table):

  - `@barefootjs/jsx`: new `index-access` `ParsedExpr` kind for element access with a non-literal index (`selected()[index]`, `rows[i + 1]`). Previously refused as "Complex computed property access"; now supported and dispatched through a new `ParsedExprEmitter.indexAccess` arm. The Perl adapters disambiguate array (`->[$i]`) from hash (`->{$k}`) deref by the index's type; Xslate/Hono use the language's polymorphic `[]`; Go emits the `index` builtin.
  - `@barefootjs/jsx`: `.toFixed(digits?)` lowers as a new `array-method` across all adapters — `bf->to_fixed` / `$bf.to_fixed` (new Perl runtime helper), `bf_to_fixed` (new Go runtime helper, `fmt.Sprintf("%.*f", …)`), native `.toFixed` on Hono.
  - `@barefootjs/jsx`: `extractSsrDefaults` now folds a block-body memo through a statically-resolvable `if (cond) return …` guard, so a `/* @client */`-guarded memo (`const key = sortKey(); if (!key) return rows; … sort …`) seeds its default-state early-return value instead of `null`.
  - `@barefootjs/mojolicious`: the test harness seeds a root signal whose initial is `null` / unevaluable as `undef` (rather than skipping it), so a getter read only in a child-prop expression doesn't fault strict vars.

  With these, the composed `data-table` demo compiles clean on both Perl adapters and renders structurally byte-identical to Hono on real Mojolicious / Text::Xslate. It stays pinned in `skipJsx` on a single remaining divergence — the scope-ID of imported components inside the keyed `.map` (a hydration-scope concern tracked with #1896), not an expression-lowering gap.

### Patch Changes

- cda5316: Fix scope-ID divergence for body children of loop-item components (#1896). Both Perl adapters now reset `inLoop` before rendering body children in `renderComponent`, so nested components (e.g. `<TableCell>` inside a looped `<TableRow>`) receive `_bf_slot` for deterministic parent-scope-derived IDs matching Hono. Removes `data-table` from `skipJsx` in both adapter conformance tests.
- 1f8b1e0: Nested `render_child` calls now resolve and carry correct slot identity. Two fixes (#1897):

  - A child template rendering another imported component (AccordionTrigger → ChevronDownIcon) executed against a fresh `BarefootJS` instance whose child-renderer registry started empty — the registry is now shared with each child instance (test harnesses + `register_components_from_manifest`).
  - `render_child` now invokes the renderer as `$renderer->($props, $invoking_bf)`, and renderer closures derive the child's scope/slot identity from the caller's scope id instead of the registrant's. A grandchild now mounts as `root_s0_s0` rather than collapsing to `root_s0` and colliding `(host, slot)` pairs (#1249 slot-identity contract). Renderer contract note: unpack `@_` (`my ($props, $caller) = @_;`) — a one-argument subroutine signature (`sub ($props)`) enforces arity and will die on the second argument.

### Patch Changes

- eb9d66a: Lower the object-rest `.map()` destructure param read via member access on all three SSR adapters, graduating the `rest-destructure-object-in-map` conformance fixture (previously pinned to BF104).

  `tasks().map(({ id, title, ...rest }) => <li>{title}:{rest.flag}</li>)` now resolves each binding against a per-item loop variable instead of refusing the destructure pattern:

  - **Go**: `{{range $_, $__bf_item0 := …}}` with `$__bf_item0.Title` / `$__bf_item0.Flag` (the `rest` binding maps to the bare range var so the member emitter renders `rest.flag` → `$__bf_item0.Flag`).
  - **Mojo**: a per-binding Perl `my` local off the item (`my $rest = $__bf_item;` so `$rest->{flag}` resolves).
  - **Xslate**: the equivalent Kolon `: my` binding locals.

  The synthetic per-item variable uses a reserved `__bf_item` name (depth-suffixed on Go) to avoid colliding with a user binding of the same name.

  Only the object-rest-via-member shape is graduated. The other three rest-destructure fixtures stay refused (BF104), because they need machinery the SSR `range`/`for` can't express inline:

  - `rest-destructure-object-spread-in-map` (`{...rest}`) needs a residual object excluding the consumed keys,
  - `rest-destructure-array-in-map` (`[a, ...t]`) needs index/slice,
  - `rest-destructure-nested-in-map` (`{ cells: [h, ...r] }`) needs nested index paths.

  A shared IR-level gate (`isLowerableObjectRestDestructure`, exported from `@barefootjs/jsx`) keeps every other shape on the existing BF104 diagnostic. It walks the whole loop subtree (elements, components, conditionals, async, providers, template literals) and refuses when the rest binding is spread or used as a bare value (`String(rest)`, `{rest}`) — those need a residual object — as well as when the loop also has a `.filter()` predicate. The Go adapter suffixes its synthetic range var with the nesting depth (`$__bf_item0`, `$__bf_item1`) so nested destructure loops don't shadow each other. Verified against real Go 1.25.6 / Mojolicious 9.35 / Text::Xslate v3.5.9; Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

- 207802f: Lower JSX `style={{ … }}` object literals to a CSS string on all three SSR adapters, graduating the `style-object-dynamic` and `style-3-signals` conformance fixtures (previously pinned to BF101 because a bare object literal in attribute position had no template form).

  A new shared `parseStyleObjectEntries` helper (`@barefootjs/jsx`) parses the object literal (wrapping in parens to force expression context, since a bare `{…}` parses as a block), kebab-cases each key (`backgroundColor` → `background-color`), and classifies each value as a static string literal or a JS expression. Each adapter assembles the CSS string with its own interpolation for dynamic values:

  - **Go**: `background-color:{{.Color}};padding:8px`
  - **Mojo**: `background-color:<%= $color %>;padding:8px`
  - **Xslate**: `background-color:<: $color :>;padding:8px`

  Each value expression is pre-checked with `isSupported`, so an unsupported value (or an unsupported object shape — spread, shorthand, computed key) keeps the existing BF101 refusal rather than emitting partial output.

  Static CSS key/value segments are HTML-attribute escaped before being inlined into the `style="…"` attribute (a value like `'"'` would otherwise break the attribute quoting / inject markup); dynamic values are escaped by each engine's own attribute context. The shared `cssKebabCase` also special-cases the `ms` vendor prefix (`msTransform` → `-ms-transform`) and is now reused by the compile-time static-style serializer so both paths agree. Verified against real Go 1.25.6 / Mojolicious 9.35 / Text::Xslate v3.5.9; Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 46d1a0d: Add `override` modifier to `renderAsync` in the Go-template, Mojolicious
  and Xslate adapters. Required by Deno's stricter `noImplicitOverride`
  default — without it `deno publish` (and `deno check`) fail with TS4114
  since `renderAsync` is provided as a concrete fallback on `BaseAdapter`,
  not declared abstract. No runtime change — `override` is a type-only
  annotation.
- 3fda4d5: `scripts/jsr-publish.ts`: drop dev-tooling-only export keys (`./build`,
  `./test-render`) and `bun:`-only conditions from the generated JSR
  manifests.

  These entries are Bun-runtime-shaped (test-render uses `Bun.*` /
  `import.meta.dir` directly; the per-adapter build helpers are wired
  for the `bf` CLI which ships as an npm executable) and never load
  cleanly under Deno's type-checker. They were the residual cause of
  `deno publish` type-check failures even after #1792 fixed import
  extensions — JSR was being asked to publish files it had no business
  type-checking against Deno's runtime.

  The npm-published surface is unchanged — these exports remain
  available to Bun / Node consumers exactly as before.

- 03c7a3c: Propagate SSR context (`<Ctx.Provider value>` → `useContext`) on the Mojolicious and Text::Xslate adapters, graduating the `context-provider` conformance fixture to Hono parity.

  Both adapters previously emitted a child template that read an un-seeded consumer variable (`$theme`), so the provider value never reached the descendant — the fixture was skipped (Go already implemented this in #1768; the Perl side was a deferred follow-up).

  The Perl runtime now mirrors the client `provideContext` / `useContext`:

  - `BarefootJS.pm` gains `provide_context` / `revoke_context` / `use_context`, backed by a package-level value stack. SSR rendering is synchronous and the provider's push/pop are perfectly balanced, so the stack always unwinds at the end of each provider subtree — and a package global (rather than `$c->stash` or the backend) is the one store reliably shared between a parent template and the child templates it renders via `render_child` (the Xslate backend runs with `c => undef`; the Mojo path lazily builds a backend per instance).
  - **Mojo**: `emitProvider` brackets the children with `<% bf->provide_context('Ctx', <value>); %>` … `<% bf->revoke_context('Ctx'); %>`, and each `useContext` consumer is seeded with `% my $x = bf->use_context('Ctx', <default>);`.
  - **Xslate**: same, using the inline `<: $bf.provide_context(...) :>` / `<: $bf.revoke_context(...) :>` form (both return `''`, so the interpolation emits nothing) and a `: my $x = $bf.use_context('Ctx', <default>);` line-statement seed.

  Verified end-to-end against real Mojolicious and Text::Xslate. Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

- f00e74d: Compute prop/signal-derived memos at SSR time on the Mojolicious and Text::Xslate adapters, graduating the `props-reactivity-comparison` conformance fixture to Hono parity.

  A memo whose body isn't statically foldable — e.g. `createMemo(() => props.value * 10)` — gets a `null` static SSR default from `extractSsrDefaults` (a bare prop access resolves to `undefined`). The Perl SSR model seeds child memos from those static defaults, so `$displayValue` was never declared and the child rendered empty (Go matches Hono because it generates a child constructor that computes the memo from the passed prop; the Perl static path had no equivalent — the reason both adapters skipped the fixture).

  Each adapter now seeds such memos in-template from the already-seeded prop/signal vars:

  - **Mojo**: `% my $displayValue = $value * 10;`
  - **Xslate**: `: my $displayValue = $value * 10;`

  The seed is emitted only when the memo's static default is `null` (statically-foldable memos stay on the existing ssr-defaults path) and when every variable the lowered expression references is already in scope (props params + signals + prior memos), so a memo over an out-of-scope binding stays on the null path rather than tripping Perl strict mode. Verified end-to-end against real Mojolicious and Text::Xslate. Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

  The memo body is extracted with a new AST-backed `extractArrowBodyExpression` helper exported from `@barefootjs/jsx` (it parses the `() => …` computation with the TypeScript parser and returns the body node text), replacing a brittle `^\(...\)\s*=>` regex that desynced on parameter defaults containing calls or nested-arrow bodies. Shared by both Perl adapters.

- 42e0ed9: Graduate the `toggle-shared` conformance fixture to Hono parity on the Mojolicious and Text::Xslate adapters — a keyed `.map` of sibling `ToggleItem` children, each with a per-item prop-derived signal. Three gaps were closed (#1297):

  1. **Prop-derived signal SSR seeding.** A signal whose init derives from a prop (`createSignal(props.defaultOn ?? false)`) is now seeded in-template from the passed prop (`% my $on = ($defaultOn // 0);` / `: my $on = ($defaultOn // 0);`), so a loop child honours its own per-item prop instead of the static default. The lowering is gated by `isSupported` (object/array/constant inits never reach `convertExpression*`, so they don't record a spurious BF101 and keep their existing ssr-defaults seeding) and skipped on Text::Xslate for a same-name signal (Kolon can't express `: my $x = … $x …`; those stay on the harness/manifest seeding, which already resolves them from the prop).

  2. **Loop-child scope id.** A loop child now gets a fresh `<ComponentName>_<rand>` scope id (the PascalCase component name) instead of a parent-slot id, matching the Hono reference (`normalizeHTML` canonicalises `<ComponentName>_<rand>` → `<ComponentName>_*`).

  3. **`data-key`.** The JSX `key` (a reserved prop) now lands as `data-key="…"` on the child scope root, for keyed-loop reconciliation parity. `BarefootJS.pm` gains a `_data_key` field + `data_key_attr` helper; `render_child` sets it from the `key` prop; the component root emits it (`bf->data_key_attr` / `$bf.data_key_attr()`), so non-keyed renders add nothing.

  Note: prop-derived signals/memos are now computed in-template from the props they derive from, so a host seeds the _prop_ (e.g. `initial`) rather than the signal value directly. Verified end-to-end against real Mojolicious and Text::Xslate. Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

  - @barefootjs/shared@0.9.3

## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- f63ece5: Honour the fixture `componentName` in the Go / Mojolicious / Xslate SSR test-render harnesses, and graduate the `props-reactivity-comparison` conformance fixture on the Go adapter.

  The three SSR test-renderers picked their entry-point IR by default-export → first-exported → first IR, ignoring the requested `componentName`. For a multi-export source (`ReactiveProps.tsx` exports both `ReactiveProps` and `PropsReactivityComparison`) this always rendered the first export, so the `PropsReactivityComparison` fixture compared the wrong component against the Hono reference. Each renderer now selects the IR whose `componentName` matches the requested name first (mirroring the Hono reference's selection), falling back to the previous heuristics for single-export sources.

  With the correct component selected, `props-reactivity-comparison` renders byte-for-byte against the Hono reference on **Go** (the generated child constructors compute the `displayValue = props.value * 10` memo from the passed prop), so it is unskipped there.

  It stays skipped on **Mojolicious / Xslate**: the child memo `displayValue = props.value * 10` is prop-derived, so `extractSsrDefaults` yields `null` and the Perl SSR model — which seeds child memos from those static defaults — never declares `$displayValue` (Kolon renders it empty; Mojo aborts under strict mode). The skip rationales are refreshed to describe this real failure mode, and the stale `toggle-shared` / `children-jsx-expression` rationales are corrected to match current behaviour (Go drops a hoisted `children={<span/>}` body rather than emitting it as literal text; `toggle-shared`'s loop-child slice types as `[]any` not `[]ToggleItemInput`). Hono reference snapshots are unchanged.

  - @barefootjs/shared@0.9.2

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 6bd31dd: Drop the vestigial `@barefootjs/perl` npm dependency from the Mojolicious and Xslate adapters. The TS adapters never import the Perl runtime as JS — `BarefootJS.pm` is resolved at the Perl layer (each `cpanfile`'s `requires 'BarefootJS'` for CPAN consumers, and `prove -I ../adapter-perl/lib` / a cpanm-installed core in CI), while the TS `test-render` locates it through a relative `../../adapter-perl/lib` path. Version lock-step is already guaranteed by the changesets `fixed` group, so the npm dependency carried no weight. Keeping it made the generated JSR manifests reference a `jsr:@barefootjs/perl` that will never exist on JSR (the Perl distribution ships `lib/*.pm`, no TS exports) and pulled a JS-less package into npm installs.

  The JSR publish script (`scripts/jsr-publish.ts`) now also only emits a `jsr:` specifier for scoped siblings that are themselves JSR-published, so a future cross-language sibling can't silently re-introduce a dangling import.

  - @barefootjs/shared@0.9.1

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 848896b: Add `runAdapterConformanceTests` for the Text::Xslate adapter (with a
  `renderXslateComponent` test renderer), validated against the same shared
  fixture corpus as mojo.

  Make the adapter's runtime-helper calls consistent: every JS-semantics-sensitive
  value operation goes through a `$bf` method, so the runtime's JS-compat handling
  is always applied (rather than a raw Kolon builtin). `.filter` / `.every` /
  `.some` / `.find` / `.findIndex` / `.findLast` / `.findLastIndex`,
  `.toLowerCase` / `.toUpperCase`, `.join`, and `.length` lower to the
  corresponding `$bf` methods — new methods
  on the `BarefootJS` runtime in `@barefootjs/perl`. This also fixes a latent bug:
  `.length` previously used Kolon's array-only `.size()`, which faults on a string;
  `$bf.length` handles both arrays (element count) and strings (char count).

  The skip list is verified, not inherited: the six fixtures mojo skips for
  Perl-EP scoping faults (`logical-or-jsx`, `nullish-coalescing-jsx`,
  `branch-map`, `return-logical-or`, `return-nullish-coalescing`, `return-map`)
  all PASS on Xslate, because Kolon resolves variables from the per-render vars
  rather than Perl lexicals. `style-object-dynamic` is pinned as a `BF101`
  diagnostic (a clean refusal) rather than skipped. Eight fixtures remain skipped
  (SSR context, multi-component scope-id harness, Phase-2b `site/ui` primitives),
  each confirmed to genuinely fail.

### Patch Changes

- 52ec729: Bring the `switch` site/ui primitive to SSR conformance parity across the Go, Mojolicious, and Xslate template adapters.

  `switch` assembles its track/thumb classes in function-scope plain consts (`trackClasses`, `thumbClasses`) rather than a `Record`-indexed memo, so it needs no `Record` SSR lowering — only two gaps blocked cross-adapter parity:

  - **Function-scope const prop enumeration.** `augmentInheritedPropAccesses` (`@barefootjs/jsx`) previously scanned memos, signals, init statements, effects, and template attributes for inherited `props.X` reads, but not function-scope const initializers. The `props.className` read inside `const trackClasses = \`… ${props.className ?? ''}\``was therefore never enumerated, so the generated struct/stash had no field to bind a caller's`className`to. It now also scans non-module local consts (module consts can't reference the function-scoped`props`, so they're skipped).

  - **`[...].join(' ')` module-const inlining on the Perl adapters.** Module consts assembled as `const stateClasses = ['[&[data-state=…]]:…', …].join(' ')` were emitted as references (`$trackStateClasses`) to bindings that don't exist server-side. A new shared `evalStringArrayJoin` helper statically evaluates the join and inlines the flattened string byte-for-byte, matching the Hono reference and the Go adapter's existing private behaviour. Wired into the Mojolicious and Xslate `parsePureStringLiteral` module-const collectors.

  `switch` is unskipped on all three adapter conformance suites. Hono reference snapshots are unchanged.

- 0cb8081: Bring the `toggle` site/ui primitive to SSR conformance parity across the Go, Mojolicious, and Xslate template adapters.

  `toggle`'s `classes` is a block-bodied `createMemo` that indexes module-scope `Record<T, string>` maps by a memo-local key with a default: `const variant = props.variant ?? 'default'; … ${variantClasses[variant]} ${sizeClasses[size]} …`. Lowering it to an SSR value required three extensions:

  - **`parseRecordIndexAccess` (`@barefootjs/jsx`)** gains an optional key resolver so the index key can be a memo-local const (resolved to its underlying prop + `?? '<lit>'` default), not only a bare prop. The result now carries that `defaultKey`. The resolver takes precedence over the same-named prop, since only the local binding carries the fallback.

  - **Go adapter** template-literal memo path now handles block-bodied arrows (collecting leading `const X = props.Y ?? 'lit'` key bindings, then resolving the single returned template literal) and emits `recordConst[key]` as an inline `map[string]string{…}[fmt.Sprint(in.Field)]`. When the key has a `'default'` fallback, the map also maps the empty key `""` to that default entry's value, so an unset prop (Go zero value `""`) renders the default instead of an empty string — matching Hono's `props.X ?? 'default'` runtime evaluation. `inferMemoType` recognises a template-literal memo as `string` (so the class-string `/` in `ring-ring/50` no longer trips the arithmetic-int heuristic).

  - **`extractSsrDefaults` (`@barefootjs/jsx`)**, the Mojo / Xslate SSR stash seed, now statically evaluates block-bodied arrows (leading `const` declarations into a local scope, then the `return` expression) and indexes a resolved object / array with a resolved scalar key, so the seeded `classes` is a concrete string. The Xslate adapter consumes this through the same SSR-seed path as Mojo.

  Also adds an HTML character-reference canonicalisation to the shared `normalizeHTML` conformance helper: a literal `"` in an attribute value (the `[class*="size-"]` in `toggle`'s base classes) is escaped as the named `&quot;` by Hono but as the numeric `&#34;` by Go's `html/template`. Both decode to the same character, so the interchangeable numeric (decimal + hex) forms are now collapsed to one canonical named form on both sides of the comparison — adapter-neutral, same motivation as the existing boolean-attribute / void-element canonicalisation.

  `toggle` is unskipped on all three adapter conformance suites. Hono reference snapshots are unchanged.

- 6561b34: Bring the Text::Xslate (Kolon) adapter to parity with the Mojolicious adapter on the Phase 2b `textarea` and `checkbox` conformance fixtures, which it previously skipped.

  Ported (in Kolon form) from the Mojo adapter:

  - **Conditional inline-object spread** — `{...(cond ? { 'aria-describedby': x } : {})}` (and the function-scope local-const form `const sizeAttrs = size ? { ... } : {}; {...sizeAttrs}`) now lowers to a Kolon inline ternary of hashrefs through `$bf.spread_attrs(...)` instead of raising `BF101`.
  - **`Record<staticKeys, scalar>[propKey]` spread value** — CheckIcon's `sizeMap[size]` lowers via the shared `parseRecordIndexAccess` to an inline bracket-indexed Kolon hashref `{ 'sm' => 16, ... }[$size]`. Note: Kolon indexes a hashref literal with bracket syntax `{…}[$key]`, not Perl's arrow-deref `{…}->{$key}` (which Kolon's parser rejects).
  - **Nullish optional-attribute omission** — an optional, no-default, nillable prop (e.g. textarea's `rows`) is now guarded with a Kolon `: if (defined $rows) { … : }` block so the attribute drops when unset rather than rendering `rows=""`.
  - **Props-object inherited-attribute enumeration** — `function Checkbox(props: CheckboxProps)` now calls the shared `augmentInheritedPropAccesses(ir)` so inherited bare optional attributes (`id={props.id}`) get the `defined`-guard.
  - **Hyphenated child rest-bag routing** — a hyphenated child prop name (`<CheckIcon data-slot="checkbox-indicator" />`) is now quoted in the `render_child` hashref (`'data-slot' => …`); an unquoted key parses as subtraction in Kolon.

  The test renderer now defers the child-compile error gate and re-checks only the components a fixture transitively references, so a sibling source file that exports an unreferenced component which legitimately can't lower to Kolon (e.g. `../icon`'s generic `Icon`, which splats `{...props}` onto child components — no Kolon form) no longer blocks a fixture that never renders it.

### Minor Changes

- 199644e: Add `@barefootjs/xslate` — a Text::Xslate (Kolon) adapter that compiles
  BarefootJS IR to `.tx` templates and ships `BarefootJS::Backend::Xslate`. Because
  the rendering backend is framework-agnostic, it runs under any PSGI/Plack app
  (no Mojolicious required). Validated end-to-end against Text::Xslate 3.5.9 and
  served live via Plack.

  The EP→Kolon mapping is mechanical (`<%= X %>` → `<: X :>`, `<%== X %>` →
  `<: X | mark_raw :>`, `bf->m` → `$bf.m()`), so the engine-agnostic
  `BarefootJS` runtime renders through Xslate unchanged.

  Also generalizes the core `render_child` (in `@barefootjs/perl`) to accept the
  single-hashref call form that Text::Xslate Kolon (and Template Toolkit) method
  calls require, in addition to the existing Mojo list form. Backward-compatible.

# @barefootjs/xslate

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 6bd31dd: Drop the vestigial `@barefootjs/perl` npm dependency from the Mojolicious and Xslate adapters. The TS adapters never import the Perl runtime as JS — `BarefootJS.pm` is resolved at the Perl layer (each `cpanfile`'s `requires 'BarefootJS'` for CPAN consumers, and `prove -I ../adapter-perl/lib` / a cpanm-installed core in CI), while the TS `test-render` locates it through a relative `../../adapter-perl/lib` path. Version lock-step is already guaranteed by the changesets `fixed` group, so the npm dependency carried no weight. Keeping it made the generated JSR manifests reference a `jsr:@barefootjs/perl` that will never exist on JSR (the Perl distribution ships `lib/*.pm`, no TS exports) and pulled a JS-less package into npm installs.

  The JSR publish script (`scripts/jsr-publish.ts`) now also only emits a `jsr:` specifier for scoped siblings that are themselves JSR-published, so a future cross-language sibling can't silently re-introduce a dangling import.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 848896b: Add `runAdapterConformanceTests` for the Text::Xslate adapter (with a
  `renderXslateComponent` test renderer), validated against the same shared
  fixture corpus as mojo.

  Make the adapter's runtime-helper calls consistent: every JS-semantics-sensitive
  value operation goes through a `$bf` method, so the runtime's JS-compat handling
  is always applied (rather than a raw Kolon builtin). `.filter` / `.every` /
  `.some` / `.find` / `.findIndex` / `.findLast` / `.findLastIndex`,
  `.toLowerCase` / `.toUpperCase`, `.join`, and `.length` lower to the
  corresponding `$bf` methods — new methods
  on the `BarefootJS` runtime in `@barefootjs/perl`. This also fixes a latent bug:
  `.length` previously used Kolon's array-only `.size()`, which faults on a string;
  `$bf.length` handles both arrays (element count) and strings (char count).

  The skip list is verified, not inherited: the six fixtures mojo skips for
  Perl-EP scoping faults (`logical-or-jsx`, `nullish-coalescing-jsx`,
  `branch-map`, `return-logical-or`, `return-nullish-coalescing`, `return-map`)
  all PASS on Xslate, because Kolon resolves variables from the per-render vars
  rather than Perl lexicals. `style-object-dynamic` is pinned as a `BF101`
  diagnostic (a clean refusal) rather than skipped. Eight fixtures remain skipped
  (SSR context, multi-component scope-id harness, Phase-2b `site/ui` primitives),
  each confirmed to genuinely fail.

### Patch Changes

- 52ec729: Bring the `switch` site/ui primitive to SSR conformance parity across the Go, Mojolicious, and Xslate template adapters.

  `switch` assembles its track/thumb classes in function-scope plain consts (`trackClasses`, `thumbClasses`) rather than a `Record`-indexed memo, so it needs no `Record` SSR lowering — only two gaps blocked cross-adapter parity:

  - **Function-scope const prop enumeration.** `augmentInheritedPropAccesses` (`@barefootjs/jsx`) previously scanned memos, signals, init statements, effects, and template attributes for inherited `props.X` reads, but not function-scope const initializers. The `props.className` read inside `const trackClasses = \`… ${props.className ?? ''}\``was therefore never enumerated, so the generated struct/stash had no field to bind a caller's`className`to. It now also scans non-module local consts (module consts can't reference the function-scoped`props`, so they're skipped).

  - **`[...].join(' ')` module-const inlining on the Perl adapters.** Module consts assembled as `const stateClasses = ['[&[data-state=…]]:…', …].join(' ')` were emitted as references (`$trackStateClasses`) to bindings that don't exist server-side. A new shared `evalStringArrayJoin` helper statically evaluates the join and inlines the flattened string byte-for-byte, matching the Hono reference and the Go adapter's existing private behaviour. Wired into the Mojolicious and Xslate `parsePureStringLiteral` module-const collectors.

  `switch` is unskipped on all three adapter conformance suites. Hono reference snapshots are unchanged.

- 0cb8081: Bring the `toggle` site/ui primitive to SSR conformance parity across the Go, Mojolicious, and Xslate template adapters.

  `toggle`'s `classes` is a block-bodied `createMemo` that indexes module-scope `Record<T, string>` maps by a memo-local key with a default: `const variant = props.variant ?? 'default'; … ${variantClasses[variant]} ${sizeClasses[size]} …`. Lowering it to an SSR value required three extensions:

  - **`parseRecordIndexAccess` (`@barefootjs/jsx`)** gains an optional key resolver so the index key can be a memo-local const (resolved to its underlying prop + `?? '<lit>'` default), not only a bare prop. The result now carries that `defaultKey`. The resolver takes precedence over the same-named prop, since only the local binding carries the fallback.

  - **Go adapter** template-literal memo path now handles block-bodied arrows (collecting leading `const X = props.Y ?? 'lit'` key bindings, then resolving the single returned template literal) and emits `recordConst[key]` as an inline `map[string]string{…}[fmt.Sprint(in.Field)]`. When the key has a `'default'` fallback, the map also maps the empty key `""` to that default entry's value, so an unset prop (Go zero value `""`) renders the default instead of an empty string — matching Hono's `props.X ?? 'default'` runtime evaluation. `inferMemoType` recognises a template-literal memo as `string` (so the class-string `/` in `ring-ring/50` no longer trips the arithmetic-int heuristic).

  - **`extractSsrDefaults` (`@barefootjs/jsx`)**, the Mojo / Xslate SSR stash seed, now statically evaluates block-bodied arrows (leading `const` declarations into a local scope, then the `return` expression) and indexes a resolved object / array with a resolved scalar key, so the seeded `classes` is a concrete string. The Xslate adapter consumes this through the same SSR-seed path as Mojo.

  Also adds an HTML character-reference canonicalisation to the shared `normalizeHTML` conformance helper: a literal `"` in an attribute value (the `[class*="size-"]` in `toggle`'s base classes) is escaped as the named `&quot;` by Hono but as the numeric `&#34;` by Go's `html/template`. Both decode to the same character, so the interchangeable numeric (decimal + hex) forms are now collapsed to one canonical named form on both sides of the comparison — adapter-neutral, same motivation as the existing boolean-attribute / void-element canonicalisation.

  `toggle` is unskipped on all three adapter conformance suites. Hono reference snapshots are unchanged.

- 6561b34: Bring the Text::Xslate (Kolon) adapter to parity with the Mojolicious adapter on the Phase 2b `textarea` and `checkbox` conformance fixtures, which it previously skipped.

  Ported (in Kolon form) from the Mojo adapter:

  - **Conditional inline-object spread** — `{...(cond ? { 'aria-describedby': x } : {})}` (and the function-scope local-const form `const sizeAttrs = size ? { ... } : {}; {...sizeAttrs}`) now lowers to a Kolon inline ternary of hashrefs through `$bf.spread_attrs(...)` instead of raising `BF101`.
  - **`Record<staticKeys, scalar>[propKey]` spread value** — CheckIcon's `sizeMap[size]` lowers via the shared `parseRecordIndexAccess` to an inline bracket-indexed Kolon hashref `{ 'sm' => 16, ... }[$size]`. Note: Kolon indexes a hashref literal with bracket syntax `{…}[$key]`, not Perl's arrow-deref `{…}->{$key}` (which Kolon's parser rejects).
  - **Nullish optional-attribute omission** — an optional, no-default, nillable prop (e.g. textarea's `rows`) is now guarded with a Kolon `: if (defined $rows) { … : }` block so the attribute drops when unset rather than rendering `rows=""`.
  - **Props-object inherited-attribute enumeration** — `function Checkbox(props: CheckboxProps)` now calls the shared `augmentInheritedPropAccesses(ir)` so inherited bare optional attributes (`id={props.id}`) get the `defined`-guard.
  - **Hyphenated child rest-bag routing** — a hyphenated child prop name (`<CheckIcon data-slot="checkbox-indicator" />`) is now quoted in the `render_child` hashref (`'data-slot' => …`); an unquoted key parses as subtraction in Kolon.

  The test renderer now defers the child-compile error gate and re-checks only the components a fixture transitively references, so a sibling source file that exports an unreferenced component which legitimately can't lower to Kolon (e.g. `../icon`'s generic `Icon`, which splats `{...props}` onto child components — no Kolon form) no longer blocks a fixture that never renders it.

### Minor Changes

- 199644e: Add `@barefootjs/xslate` — a Text::Xslate (Kolon) adapter that compiles
  BarefootJS IR to `.tx` templates and ships `BarefootJS::Backend::Xslate`. Because
  the rendering backend is framework-agnostic, it runs under any PSGI/Plack app
  (no Mojolicious required). Validated end-to-end against Text::Xslate 3.5.9 and
  served live via Plack.

  The EP→Kolon mapping is mechanical (`<%= X %>` → `<: X :>`, `<%== X %>` →
  `<: X | mark_raw :>`, `bf->m` → `$bf.m()`), so the engine-agnostic
  `BarefootJS` runtime renders through Xslate unchanged.

  Also generalizes the core `render_child` (in `@barefootjs/perl`) to accept the
  single-hashref call form that Text::Xslate Kolon (and Template Toolkit) method
  calls require, in addition to the existing Mojo list form. Backward-compatible.

/**
 * BfScripts Component
 *
 * Renders collected script tags at the end of the document body.
 * BarefootJS components collect their script URLs during SSR render,
 * and this component outputs them all at once to avoid DOM traversal issues.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```tsx
 * import { BfScripts } from '@barefoot/hono/scripts'
 *
 * <html>
 *   <body>
 *     {children}
 *     <BfScripts manifest={manifest} base="/static/components/" />
 *   </body>
 * </html>
 * ```
 *
 * Pass `manifest` + `base` to follow stub references emitted by the
 * 'use client' import rewriter (#1241). Without those props the
 * component falls back to the JSX-driven script set, which misses
 * components reached only through imperative `createComponent()`
 * stub calls — see issue #1243.

/**
 * Walk stub-rewrite edges from each manifest entry in `roots`,
 * returning the script URLs for every transitively reachable
 * `.client.js` in **DFS post-order** — every dep precedes its
 * dependent in iteration order. Skips any name already present in
 * `excluded` (these have a script tag elsewhere). Mutates `excluded`
 * to record every dep that's been resolved so the caller can pass
 * it to the next SSR pass without double-emitting. Exported for tests.
 *
 * Typical call shape: `roots` ⊆ `excluded`. The caller passes the
 * set of components whose SSR function already pushed a `<script>`
 * (`bfOutputScripts`) as BOTH arguments — "these are already
 * emitted, now walk their stubDeps." A `roots` value already in
 * `excluded` is still walked (we need its `stubDeps`); a `dep`
 * already in `excluded` is recorded as visited but not re-emitted.
 *
 * Why post-order: `<script type="module">` tags evaluate in document
 * order with microtask checkpoints between them, so the first
 * script's `hydrate()`-scheduled walk fires before any later
 * module loads. A chain A→B→C must ship C, B, then A's bundle —
 * BFS order (B, C) would let B's hydration call
 * `createComponent('C', ...)` against an empty registry. Post-order
 * also handles DAG edges like A→B, A→C, C→B correctly
 * (deepest-first, dependencies-first).
 *
 * Cycle-safe: a visited set short-circuits any A → B → A loop.

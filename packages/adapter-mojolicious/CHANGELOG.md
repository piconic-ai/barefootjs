### Patch Changes

- eb9d66a: Lower the object-rest `.map()` destructure param read via member access on all three SSR adapters, graduating the `rest-destructure-object-in-map` conformance fixture (previously pinned to BF104).

  `tasks().map(({ id, title, ...rest }) => <li>{title}:{rest.flag}</li>)` now resolves each binding against a per-item loop variable instead of refusing the destructure pattern:

  - **Go**: `{{range $_, $__bf_item0 := …}}` with `$__bf_item0.Title` / `$__bf_item0.Flag` (the `rest` binding maps to the bare range var so the member emitter renders `rest.flag` → `$__bf_item0.Flag`).
  - **Mojo**: a per-binding Perl `my` local off the item (`my $rest = $__bf_item;` so `$rest->{flag}` resolves).
  - **Xslate**: the equivalent Kolon `: my` binding locals.

  The synthetic per-item variable uses a reserved `__bf_item` name (depth-suffixed on Go) to avoid colliding with a user binding of the same name.

  Only the object-rest-via-member shape is graduated. The other three rest-destructure fixtures stay refused (BF104), because they need machinery the SSR `range`/`for` can't express inline:

  - `rest-destructure-object-spread-in-map` (`{...rest}`) needs a residual object excluding the consumed keys,
  - `rest-destructure-array-in-map` (`[a, ...t]`) needs index/slice,
  - `rest-destructure-nested-in-map` (`{ cells: [h, ...r] }`) needs nested index paths.

  A shared IR-level gate (`isLowerableObjectRestDestructure`, exported from `@barefootjs/jsx`) keeps every other shape on the existing BF104 diagnostic. It walks the whole loop subtree (elements, components, conditionals, async, providers, template literals) and refuses when the rest binding is spread or used as a bare value (`String(rest)`, `{rest}`) — those need a residual object — as well as when the loop also has a `.filter()` predicate. The Go adapter suffixes its synthetic range var with the nesting depth (`$__bf_item0`, `$__bf_item1`) so nested destructure loops don't shadow each other. Verified against real Go 1.25.6 / Mojolicious 9.35 / Text::Xslate v3.5.9; Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

- 207802f: Lower JSX `style={{ … }}` object literals to a CSS string on all three SSR adapters, graduating the `style-object-dynamic` and `style-3-signals` conformance fixtures (previously pinned to BF101 because a bare object literal in attribute position had no template form).

  A new shared `parseStyleObjectEntries` helper (`@barefootjs/jsx`) parses the object literal (wrapping in parens to force expression context, since a bare `{…}` parses as a block), kebab-cases each key (`backgroundColor` → `background-color`), and classifies each value as a static string literal or a JS expression. Each adapter assembles the CSS string with its own interpolation for dynamic values:

  - **Go**: `background-color:{{.Color}};padding:8px`
  - **Mojo**: `background-color:<%= $color %>;padding:8px`
  - **Xslate**: `background-color:<: $color :>;padding:8px`

  Each value expression is pre-checked with `isSupported`, so an unsupported value (or an unsupported object shape — spread, shorthand, computed key) keeps the existing BF101 refusal rather than emitting partial output.

  Static CSS key/value segments are HTML-attribute escaped before being inlined into the `style="…"` attribute (a value like `'"'` would otherwise break the attribute quoting / inject markup); dynamic values are escaped by each engine's own attribute context. The shared `cssKebabCase` also special-cases the `ms` vendor prefix (`msTransform` → `-ms-transform`) and is now reused by the compile-time static-style serializer so both paths agree. Verified against real Go 1.25.6 / Mojolicious 9.35 / Text::Xslate v3.5.9; Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

  The runtime helpers (`bf->find` / `find_index` / `find_last` / `find_last_index`) already existed and the Xslate adapter already lowered these via a Kolon lambda; only the Mojo `higherOrder` emitter still refused them. It now emits `bf->find($arr, sub { my $x = $_[0]; <pred> })` (a per-element coderef predicate, the same shape as `.filter` / `.some` / `.every`), with the camelCase JS names mapping to the snake_case helpers. Verified against real Mojolicious; Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 46d1a0d: Add `override` modifier to `renderAsync` in the Go-template, Mojolicious
  and Xslate adapters. Required by Deno's stricter `noImplicitOverride`
  default — without it `deno publish` (and `deno check`) fail with TS4114
  since `renderAsync` is provided as a concrete fallback on `BaseAdapter`,
  not declared abstract. No runtime change — `override` is a type-only
  annotation.
- 3fda4d5: `scripts/jsr-publish.ts`: drop dev-tooling-only export keys (`./build`,
  `./test-render`) and `bun:`-only conditions from the generated JSR
  manifests.

  These entries are Bun-runtime-shaped (test-render uses `Bun.*` /
  `import.meta.dir` directly; the per-adapter build helpers are wired
  for the `bf` CLI which ships as an npm executable) and never load
  cleanly under Deno's type-checker. They were the residual cause of
  `deno publish` type-check failures even after #1792 fixed import
  extensions — JSR was being asked to publish files it had no business
  type-checking against Deno's runtime.

  The npm-published surface is unchanged — these exports remain
  available to Bun / Node consumers exactly as before.

- 03c7a3c: Propagate SSR context (`<Ctx.Provider value>` → `useContext`) on the Mojolicious and Text::Xslate adapters, graduating the `context-provider` conformance fixture to Hono parity.

  Both adapters previously emitted a child template that read an un-seeded consumer variable (`$theme`), so the provider value never reached the descendant — the fixture was skipped (Go already implemented this in #1768; the Perl side was a deferred follow-up).

  The Perl runtime now mirrors the client `provideContext` / `useContext`:

  - `BarefootJS.pm` gains `provide_context` / `revoke_context` / `use_context`, backed by a package-level value stack. SSR rendering is synchronous and the provider's push/pop are perfectly balanced, so the stack always unwinds at the end of each provider subtree — and a package global (rather than `$c->stash` or the backend) is the one store reliably shared between a parent template and the child templates it renders via `render_child` (the Xslate backend runs with `c => undef`; the Mojo path lazily builds a backend per instance).
  - **Mojo**: `emitProvider` brackets the children with `<% bf->provide_context('Ctx', <value>); %>` … `<% bf->revoke_context('Ctx'); %>`, and each `useContext` consumer is seeded with `% my $x = bf->use_context('Ctx', <default>);`.
  - **Xslate**: same, using the inline `<: $bf.provide_context(...) :>` / `<: $bf.revoke_context(...) :>` form (both return `''`, so the interpolation emits nothing) and a `: my $x = $bf.use_context('Ctx', <default>);` line-statement seed.

  Verified end-to-end against real Mojolicious and Text::Xslate. Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

- f00e74d: Compute prop/signal-derived memos at SSR time on the Mojolicious and Text::Xslate adapters, graduating the `props-reactivity-comparison` conformance fixture to Hono parity.

  A memo whose body isn't statically foldable — e.g. `createMemo(() => props.value * 10)` — gets a `null` static SSR default from `extractSsrDefaults` (a bare prop access resolves to `undefined`). The Perl SSR model seeds child memos from those static defaults, so `$displayValue` was never declared and the child rendered empty (Go matches Hono because it generates a child constructor that computes the memo from the passed prop; the Perl static path had no equivalent — the reason both adapters skipped the fixture).

  Each adapter now seeds such memos in-template from the already-seeded prop/signal vars:

  - **Mojo**: `% my $displayValue = $value * 10;`
  - **Xslate**: `: my $displayValue = $value * 10;`

  The seed is emitted only when the memo's static default is `null` (statically-foldable memos stay on the existing ssr-defaults path) and when every variable the lowered expression references is already in scope (props params + signals + prior memos), so a memo over an out-of-scope binding stays on the null path rather than tripping Perl strict mode. Verified end-to-end against real Mojolicious and Text::Xslate. Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

  The memo body is extracted with a new AST-backed `extractArrowBodyExpression` helper exported from `@barefootjs/jsx` (it parses the `() => …` computation with the TypeScript parser and returns the body node text), replacing a brittle `^\(...\)\s*=>` regex that desynced on parameter defaults containing calls or nested-arrow bodies. Shared by both Perl adapters.

- 42e0ed9: Graduate the `toggle-shared` conformance fixture to Hono parity on the Mojolicious and Text::Xslate adapters — a keyed `.map` of sibling `ToggleItem` children, each with a per-item prop-derived signal. Three gaps were closed (#1297):

  1. **Prop-derived signal SSR seeding.** A signal whose init derives from a prop (`createSignal(props.defaultOn ?? false)`) is now seeded in-template from the passed prop (`% my $on = ($defaultOn // 0);` / `: my $on = ($defaultOn // 0);`), so a loop child honours its own per-item prop instead of the static default. The lowering is gated by `isSupported` (object/array/constant inits never reach `convertExpression*`, so they don't record a spurious BF101 and keep their existing ssr-defaults seeding) and skipped on Text::Xslate for a same-name signal (Kolon can't express `: my $x = … $x …`; those stay on the harness/manifest seeding, which already resolves them from the prop).

  2. **Loop-child scope id.** A loop child now gets a fresh `<ComponentName>_<rand>` scope id (the PascalCase component name) instead of a parent-slot id, matching the Hono reference (`normalizeHTML` canonicalises `<ComponentName>_<rand>` → `<ComponentName>_*`).

  3. **`data-key`.** The JSX `key` (a reserved prop) now lands as `data-key="…"` on the child scope root, for keyed-loop reconciliation parity. `BarefootJS.pm` gains a `_data_key` field + `data_key_attr` helper; `render_child` sets it from the `key` prop; the component root emits it (`bf->data_key_attr` / `$bf.data_key_attr()`), so non-keyed renders add nothing.

  Note: prop-derived signals/memos are now computed in-template from the props they derive from, so a host seeds the _prop_ (e.g. `initial`) rather than the signal value directly. Verified end-to-end against real Mojolicious and Text::Xslate. Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

  - @barefootjs/shared@0.9.3

## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- f63ece5: Honour the fixture `componentName` in the Go / Mojolicious / Xslate SSR test-render harnesses, and graduate the `props-reactivity-comparison` conformance fixture on the Go adapter.

  The three SSR test-renderers picked their entry-point IR by default-export → first-exported → first IR, ignoring the requested `componentName`. For a multi-export source (`ReactiveProps.tsx` exports both `ReactiveProps` and `PropsReactivityComparison`) this always rendered the first export, so the `PropsReactivityComparison` fixture compared the wrong component against the Hono reference. Each renderer now selects the IR whose `componentName` matches the requested name first (mirroring the Hono reference's selection), falling back to the previous heuristics for single-export sources.

  With the correct component selected, `props-reactivity-comparison` renders byte-for-byte against the Hono reference on **Go** (the generated child constructors compute the `displayValue = props.value * 10` memo from the passed prop), so it is unskipped there.

  It stays skipped on **Mojolicious / Xslate**: the child memo `displayValue = props.value * 10` is prop-derived, so `extractSsrDefaults` yields `null` and the Perl SSR model — which seeds child memos from those static defaults — never declares `$displayValue` (Kolon renders it empty; Mojo aborts under strict mode). The skip rationales are refreshed to describe this real failure mode, and the stale `toggle-shared` / `children-jsx-expression` rationales are corrected to match current behaviour (Go drops a hoisted `children={<span/>}` body rather than emitting it as literal text; `toggle-shared`'s loop-child slice types as `[]any` not `[]ToggleItemInput`). Hono reference snapshots are unchanged.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 6bd31dd: Drop the vestigial `@barefootjs/perl` npm dependency from the Mojolicious and Xslate adapters. The TS adapters never import the Perl runtime as JS — `BarefootJS.pm` is resolved at the Perl layer (each `cpanfile`'s `requires 'BarefootJS'` for CPAN consumers, and `prove -I ../adapter-perl/lib` / a cpanm-installed core in CI), while the TS `test-render` locates it through a relative `../../adapter-perl/lib` path. Version lock-step is already guaranteed by the changesets `fixed` group, so the npm dependency carried no weight. Keeping it made the generated JSR manifests reference a `jsr:@barefootjs/perl` that will never exist on JSR (the Perl distribution ships `lib/*.pm`, no TS exports) and pulled a JS-less package into npm installs.

  The JSR publish script (`scripts/jsr-publish.ts`) now also only emits a `jsr:` specifier for scoped siblings that are themselves JSR-published, so a future cross-language sibling can't silently re-introduce a dangling import.

## 0.9.0

### Patch Changes

- 7d91adc: Resolve local-const conditional spreads and `Record`-indexed spread values on intrinsic elements. Two related spread shapes that previously raised `BF101` now compile on both template adapters.

  Local-const conditional spread: a function-scope const holding a `cond ? { ... } : {}` ternary, spread as a bare identifier (`const sizeAttrs = size ? { ... } : {}; <svg {...sizeAttrs} />`), now resolves to that initializer and routes through the existing conditional-spread lowering. Only function-scope (non-module) consts qualify, and a const that aliases another bare identifier is not forwarded (loop guard) — it falls through to the standard path.

  `Record<staticKeys, scalar>[propKey]` spread value: a spread-object value of the form `IDENT[KEY]`, where `IDENT` is a module-scope `Record<staticKeys, scalar>` object literal (all scalar number/string values under static keys) and `KEY` is a bare prop identifier, now lowers to an inline indexed map. Go emits `map[string]any{"sm": 16, ...}[fmt.Sprint(in.Size)]` (adding the `"fmt"` import only when this fires); Mojo emits `{ 'sm' => 16, ... }->{$size}`. Any non-scalar value, non-static key, or non-prop index still falls through to `BF101`.

  Together these let the `CheckIcon` sibling (`ui/components/ui/icon`) — `const sizeAttrs = size ? { width: sizeMap[size], height: sizeMap[size] } : {}` spread onto its `<svg>` — compile standalone with zero `BF101` on both adapters.

  Additionally, unblock the Phase 2b `checkbox` conformance fixture end-to-end on both template adapters (Go + Mojolicious), which composes `CheckIcon` and uses the SolidJS props-object pattern:

  - **Sibling import survival (Go test harness).** The Go conformance harness strips each merged sibling type block's `import (...)`; it now re-adds standard-library imports a merged block still needs (today `"fmt"`, used by `CheckIcon`'s `fmt.Sprint(...)` `Record[key]` lookup) so the combined unit resolves the symbol. The harness also now emits only the child components a parent transitively references — a child _file_ exporting many components (`../icon`'s 30+ icons) no longer drags in dead components whose own codegen wouldn't compile (e.g. an icon's `strokePaths['chevron-down']` lowering to an invalid `{{.StrokePaths.Chevron-down}}`).
  - **Cross-component child rest-bag routing.** A child component attribute whose name isn't a declared child param and isn't a valid identifier (`<CheckIcon data-slot="checkbox-indicator" />`) now routes into the child's rest bag — Go's `Props map[string]any` field / Mojo's quoted `'data-slot' => ...` `render_child` arg — instead of an invalid hyphenated field (`Data-slot:`) or Perl bareword.
  - **Props-object inherited-attribute enumeration.** A component written as `function C(props: P)` only enumerates `P`'s own members; inherited `*HTMLAttributes` members it actually reads (`props.className`, `props.id`, `props.disabled`) are now enumerated as Input/Props fields (Go) / declared stash vars + `defined`-guarded attributes (Mojo), so a caller's `className` / `id` / `disabled` bind and unset optionals are omitted (Hono parity).
  - **Template-literal className memo + boolean memo SSR value.** The Go adapter computes a template-literal `classes` memo's SSR initial value by inlining module string consts (including `[…].join(' ')` consts) and resolving `props.className ?? ''`; a boolean ternary memo (`isChecked`) now renders its zero as `false` (not `0`). The `@barefootjs/jsx` `extractSsrDefaults` (Mojo's SSR seed) gains module-const seeding and `.join()` evaluation so the same `classes` memo resolves to a concrete string instead of empty.

  With these, `checkbox` is unskipped on both adapter conformance suites at byte parity with the Hono reference. `toggle` / `switch` share the inherited-attr fix but remain skipped (they carry an additional `Record[key]`-in-memo-className blocker).

- fcf28cd: Fix the Mojolicious test renderer's child component scope id: it hardcoded a
  literal `test_<slotId>` prefix, so a composed child rendered
  `bf-s="test_s5"` instead of `<parentScope>_<slotId>` (e.g.
  `ReactiveProps_test_s5`) like Hono / CSR. Children now derive their scope id
  from the parent's live `$bf->_scope_id`, mirroring the xslate adapter's
  `rootChildScopePrefix`. This unblocks the `reactive-props` conformance fixture
  on Mojo (xslate already passed it), bringing the two Perl-targeting adapters
  to parity on it.
- 52ec729: Bring the `switch` site/ui primitive to SSR conformance parity across the Go, Mojolicious, and Xslate template adapters.

  `switch` assembles its track/thumb classes in function-scope plain consts (`trackClasses`, `thumbClasses`) rather than a `Record`-indexed memo, so it needs no `Record` SSR lowering — only two gaps blocked cross-adapter parity:

  - **Function-scope const prop enumeration.** `augmentInheritedPropAccesses` (`@barefootjs/jsx`) previously scanned memos, signals, init statements, effects, and template attributes for inherited `props.X` reads, but not function-scope const initializers. The `props.className` read inside `const trackClasses = \`… ${props.className ?? ''}\``was therefore never enumerated, so the generated struct/stash had no field to bind a caller's`className`to. It now also scans non-module local consts (module consts can't reference the function-scoped`props`, so they're skipped).

  - **`[...].join(' ')` module-const inlining on the Perl adapters.** Module consts assembled as `const stateClasses = ['[&[data-state=…]]:…', …].join(' ')` were emitted as references (`$trackStateClasses`) to bindings that don't exist server-side. A new shared `evalStringArrayJoin` helper statically evaluates the join and inlines the flattened string byte-for-byte, matching the Hono reference and the Go adapter's existing private behaviour. Wired into the Mojolicious and Xslate `parsePureStringLiteral` module-const collectors.

  `switch` is unskipped on all three adapter conformance suites. Hono reference snapshots are unchanged.

- 0cb8081: Bring the `toggle` site/ui primitive to SSR conformance parity across the Go, Mojolicious, and Xslate template adapters.

  `toggle`'s `classes` is a block-bodied `createMemo` that indexes module-scope `Record<T, string>` maps by a memo-local key with a default: `const variant = props.variant ?? 'default'; … ${variantClasses[variant]} ${sizeClasses[size]} …`. Lowering it to an SSR value required three extensions:

  - **`parseRecordIndexAccess` (`@barefootjs/jsx`)** gains an optional key resolver so the index key can be a memo-local const (resolved to its underlying prop + `?? '<lit>'` default), not only a bare prop. The result now carries that `defaultKey`. The resolver takes precedence over the same-named prop, since only the local binding carries the fallback.

  - **Go adapter** template-literal memo path now handles block-bodied arrows (collecting leading `const X = props.Y ?? 'lit'` key bindings, then resolving the single returned template literal) and emits `recordConst[key]` as an inline `map[string]string{…}[fmt.Sprint(in.Field)]`. When the key has a `'default'` fallback, the map also maps the empty key `""` to that default entry's value, so an unset prop (Go zero value `""`) renders the default instead of an empty string — matching Hono's `props.X ?? 'default'` runtime evaluation. `inferMemoType` recognises a template-literal memo as `string` (so the class-string `/` in `ring-ring/50` no longer trips the arithmetic-int heuristic).

  - **`extractSsrDefaults` (`@barefootjs/jsx`)**, the Mojo / Xslate SSR stash seed, now statically evaluates block-bodied arrows (leading `const` declarations into a local scope, then the `return` expression) and indexes a resolved object / array with a resolved scalar key, so the seeded `classes` is a concrete string. The Xslate adapter consumes this through the same SSR-seed path as Mojo.

  Also adds an HTML character-reference canonicalisation to the shared `normalizeHTML` conformance helper: a literal `"` in an attribute value (the `[class*="size-"]` in `toggle`'s base classes) is escaped as the named `&quot;` by Hono but as the numeric `&#34;` by Go's `html/template`. Both decode to the same character, so the interchangeable numeric (decimal + hex) forms are now collapsed to one canonical named form on both sides of the comparison — adapter-neutral, same motivation as the existing boolean-attribute / void-element canonicalisation.

  `toggle` is unskipped on all three adapter conformance suites. Hono reference snapshots are unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 3ed9659: Add `BarefootJS::DevReload` — framework-agnostic dev browser auto-reload. The
  shared module provides the browser snippet, the `<dist>/.dev/build-id` reader,
  and a ready-made PSGI streaming app (`->to_app`) for the SSE endpoint, so plain
  PSGI/Plack hosts (e.g. the Text::Xslate backend) get the same `barefoot build
--watch` auto-reload as Mojolicious. `Mojolicious::Plugin::BarefootJS::DevReload`
  now delegates its snippet and build-id logic to the shared module (no behaviour
  change).

### Patch Changes

- eab6566: Lower conditional inline-object spreads on intrinsic elements. A spread of the shape `{...(cond ? { 'aria-describedby': value } : {})}` (either branch possibly `{}`) now compiles on both template adapters instead of raising `BF101`.

  The Go adapter builds the spread bag as an immediately-invoked `func() map[string]any { ... }()` in `NewXxxProps` that conditionally returns the populated map or an empty one. The Mojo adapter emits an equivalent Perl inline ternary of hashrefs (`$cond ? { 'aria-describedby' => $value } : {}`) through `bf->spread_attrs`. In both adapters the falsy branch yields an empty bag so the key is omitted rather than rendered as an empty-string attribute (neither `SpreadAttrs` nor `bf->spread_attrs` filters empty strings).

  The condition supports a bare prop identifier and its negation; object keys must be static string/identifier names and values resolve prop references (`in.Field` / `$prop`) or string literals. Any other shape still falls through to the existing `BF101` refusal.

  Additionally, both adapters now honour Hono-style nullish-attribute omission for dynamic attributes. When an attribute value is a bare reference to a nillable prop (Go: a field whose resolved type is `interface{}`; Mojo: a prop with no destructure default and a non-primitive type), the attribute is guarded so an unset value drops the attribute entirely instead of rendering `attr=""`. Go emits `{{if ne .Rows nil}}rows="{{.Rows}}"{{end}}`; Mojo emits `<% if (defined $rows) { %>rows="<%= $rows %>"<% } %>`. Concrete-typed (`string`/`int`/`bool`) and defaulted props are unaffected and still emit unconditionally (matching Hono's `value=""` / `data-count="0"`). This unblocks the `textarea` fixture's optional `rows?: number` prop on both adapter conformance suites.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ac91bc6: Extract the engine-agnostic Perl runtime (`BarefootJS.pm`) into a new
  `@barefootjs/perl` package. `@barefootjs/mojolicious` now depends on it and
  keeps only the Mojo-specific pieces — `BarefootJS::Backend::Mojo`, the
  `Mojolicious::Plugin::BarefootJS` binding, and the compile-time adapter that
  emits Embedded Perl (`.html.ep`).

  The runtime is Mojo-free at load time and drives any Perl template engine
  through a pluggable backend (`encode_json` / `mark_raw` / `materialize` /
  `render_named`), with an injectable JSON encoder. SSR output is unchanged for
  the Mojolicious path.

  Note for consumers that wire Perl `@INC` by hand: `BarefootJS.pm` now ships in
  `@barefootjs/perl/lib` rather than `@barefootjs/mojolicious/lib`. Point `@INC`
  at both package `lib/` directories (the Mojolicious integration's build does
  this automatically).

### Patch Changes

- c02017b: Inline module-scope pure string-literal constants referenced in
  expressions (e.g. `const labelClasses = '...'` used in a `className`
  template literal) on the Go and Mojo template adapters. Previously such
  an identifier lowered to an unpopulated struct-field / stash-variable
  reference (`{{.LabelClasses}}` on Go — failing `can't evaluate field
LabelClasses`; `$labelClasses` on Mojo — rendering empty), because a
  module const is neither a prop, signal, nor local and no field/var ever
  bound it. The adapters now resolve the identifier through the IR's
  `localConstants` and inline the literal value (escaped for the target
  template language), matching what the Hono reference produces by
  evaluating the real JS. Only module-scope pure string literals qualify —
  `Record<T,string>` indexed lookups, memos, signals, and function-scope
  locals are deliberately excluded — and inlining is suppressed for any name
  shadowed by an enclosing loop binding (matching the Go adapter's
  loop-shadowing guards). This unblocks cross-adapter conformance for the
  `site/ui` `label` and `input` primitives.

  The Mojolicious adapter now relies on `typescript` at runtime (to parse
  const initializers), so it is externalized in the build and declared as a
  peer dependency, consistent with `@barefootjs/go-template`.

### Patch Changes

- 2d4edce: Lower `Array.prototype.flat(depth?)` to the template-language adapters (#1448 Tier C).

  The value-returning `.flat()` now compiles on both template adapters instead of refusing with BF101. The flatten depth is validated to a literal and normalised at parse time:

  - `arr.flat()` — flatten one level (the JS default)
  - `arr.flat(n)` — flatten `n` levels (a fractional literal truncates toward zero; a `0` / negative depth normalises to "no flatten" → shallow copy, matching JS)
  - `arr.flat(Infinity)` — flatten fully
  - a **non-literal** depth refuses with BF101 (it can't be resolved at template time) and keeps `/* @client */` as the escape hatch — `@client` is not suggested for this case since the remedy is a literal depth or pre-computing

  Non-array nested elements are preserved (JS only flattens nested arrays). This is the first half of the `.flat` / `.flatMap` Tier C row; the value-returning `.flatMap` stays deferred (the JSX-returning `.flatMap` already lowers as an `IRLoop`).

  - Parser: new `array-method` variant `flat` carrying a structured `FlatDepth` (`number | 'infinity'`); `flat` is removed from `UNSUPPORTED_METHODS`.
  - Emitter: new `flatMethod()` arm on `ParsedExprEmitter` — adding it makes every adapter implementor a TS compile error until handled (the same drift defence sort / reduce use).
  - Go: new `bf_flat` runtime helper (reflect-based recursive flatten; `-1` is the `Infinity` sentinel).
  - Mojo: new `bf->flat` helper (recursive ARRAY-ref flatten; same `-1` sentinel).

  Conformance fixtures (`array-flat`, `array-flat-depth`, `array-flat-infinity`) pin byte-equal output across Hono/CSR, Go, and Mojo.

- 8daf057: Lower value-returning `Array.prototype.flatMap(fn)` field projection to the template-language adapters (#1448 Tier C).

  The field-projection form of `.flatMap` now compiles on both template adapters instead of refusing with BF101. The callback is validated and extracted into a structured `FlatMapOp` at parse time (mirroring `.reduce` / `.sort`):

  - `arr.flatMap(i => i)` — self projection (equivalent to `.flat(1)`)
  - `arr.flatMap(i => i.field)` — flatten a per-item array field (the dominant real-world case, e.g. `items.flatMap(i => i.tags)`)
  - single-`return` block bodies unwrap to the returned expression

  The projected per-item value is flattened one level (`flatMap` = map + `flat(1)`); a non-array projection is kept as-is, matching JS. This composes as a loop base too — `items.flatMap(i => i.tags).map(t => <li>{t}</li>)` now lowers to a loop over the flattened array instead of refusing.

  Out-of-catalogue callbacks — array-literal / transform projections (`i => [i.a, i.b]`), deep field access (`i => i.a.b`), and the index/array callback params — stay refused with BF101 and keep `/* @client */` as the escape hatch. The JSX-returning `.flatMap` continues to lower as an `IRLoop` upstream (unchanged).

  - Parser: new `array-method` variant `flatMap` carrying a structured `FlatMapOp`; `flatMap` stays in `UNSUPPORTED_METHODS` so the degenerate / out-of-catalogue forms still refuse loudly.
  - Emitter: new `flatMapMethod()` arm on `ParsedExprEmitter` (drift defence, same as sort / reduce / flat).
  - Go: new `bf_flat_map` runtime helper (reflect-based projection + one-level flatten, reusing `getFieldValue` and `Flat`).
  - Mojo: new `bf->flat_map` helper (HASH-ref field projection + `flat(1)`).

  Conformance fixtures (`array-flatmap-field`, `array-flatmap-self`) pin byte-equal output across Hono/CSR, Go, and Mojo.

- 0a05dfc: Lower the array-literal (tuple) form of value-returning `Array.prototype.flatMap(fn)` to the template-language adapters (#1448 Tier C).

  Building on the field-projection form (#1734), the array-literal projection now compiles:

  - `arr.flatMap(i => [i.a, i.b])` — gather per-item fields into a flat list
  - `arr.flatMap(i => [i, i.tags])` — mixed self / field leaves

  Every array-literal element must be a `self` (`i`) or `field` (`i.field`) leaf. flatMap's one-level flatten removes only the array-literal wrapper, so each leaf is appended verbatim — an array-valued leaf is kept as a single element (not spread), matching JS `map(...).flat(1)`. A non-object element under a field leaf yields `undefined` / `nil`.

  Richer callbacks — elements with arithmetic / computed or deep access / calls / literals, the spread (`[...xs]`) form, and the 2-arg `flatMap(fn, thisArg)` form — stay refused with BF101 and keep `/* @client */` as the escape hatch.

  - Parser: `FlatMapOp.projection` gains a `tuple` variant (a list of `FlatMapLeaf`s); `extractFlatMapOpFromTS` classifies each array-literal element.
  - Go: new `bf_flat_map_tuple` runtime helper (variadic `(kind, name)` leaf specs).
  - Mojo: new `bf->flat_map_tuple` helper (one `[kind, key]` arrayref per leaf).

  Conformance fixture `array-flatmap-tuple` pins byte-equal output across Hono/CSR, Go, and Mojo. This completes the `.flat` / `.flatMap` Tier C row.

- 9420ef8: Lower `Array.prototype.reduceRight(fn, init)` to the template-language adapters (#1448 Tier C follow-up).

  `.reduceRight` reuses the `.reduce` arithmetic-fold catalogue (#1728) — same `ReduceOp` shapes (numeric sum / product over self or a field, string concatenation, single-`return` block bodies, literal init) — and threads a fold **direction** through to the runtime. The direction is only observable for string concatenation: a left-to-right concat of `[a, b, c]` is `abc`, while right-to-left is `cba`. Numeric sum / product are commutative, so the direction doesn't change them.

  - Parser: the existing reduce interception now also accepts `reduceRight`, preserving the method name on the `array-method` variant. Off-catalogue / no-init forms still refuse with BF101.
  - Emitter: `reduceMethod()` now receives the method name (mirroring `sortMethod()`), so adapters pick the direction.
  - Go: `bf_reduce` gains a trailing `"<direction>"` operand and folds right-to-left when it's `"right"`.
  - Mojo: `bf->reduce` takes a `direction => 'left' | 'right'` option and reverses the snapshot for `'right'`.

  Cross-adapter byte-equality (Hono/CSR, Go, Mojo) verified by a new `reduce-right-concat` conformance fixture (the concat case is the direction discriminator).

- b4a8df8: Lower `Array.prototype.reduce(fn, init)` arithmetic-fold catalogue to the template-language adapters (#1448 Tier C).

  The shapes that recur across the demo components (`playlist.reduce((s, t) => s + t.duration, 0)`, view-count / visitor sums, …) now compile on both template adapters. The accepted catalogue mirrors the `.sort` precedent (a finite, structured form rather than an arbitrary reducer body):

  - `arr.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0)` — numeric sum over self
  - `arr.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x.field, 0)` — numeric sum over a struct field
  - `arr.reduce((acc, x) => acc * x.field, 1)` — numeric product
  - `arr.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x.field, '')` — string concatenation (string init flips `+` to concat)
  - single-`return` block bodies are unwrapped to the returned expression

  The accumulator must be the binary expression's left operand (`acc + x`, not `x + acc`), the per-item operand must be the item param or a single non-computed field access on it, and the init must be a number or string literal. Anything else (subtraction / division, deep field access, object-building reducers, 3- / 4-param forms, `.reduce(fn)` without an initial value) refuses with BF101 and keeps `/* @client */` as the escape hatch. `.reduceRight` stays refused entirely.

  - Parser: new `array-method` variant `reduce` with a structured `ReduceOp` (op / key / type / init) extracted at parse time; `reduce` stays in `UNSUPPORTED_METHODS` so the no-init fall-through still refuses loudly.
  - Emitter: new `reduceMethod()` arm on `ParsedExprEmitter` — adding it makes every adapter implementor a TS compile error until they handle it (the same drift defence sort uses).
  - Go: new `bf_reduce` runtime helper folding to float64 for numeric / Go string for concat.
  - Mojo: new `bf->reduce` helper folding via Perl numeric / string operators.

  Two narrow divergences from the JS / CSR path, both mirroring the `bf_sort` "auto" caveat: float stringification differs for inexact binary fractions (e.g. `0.1 + 0.2`), and numeric-_string_ keys fold numerically on the template adapters while JS `+` string-concatenates them. Genuine numbers — the common SSR case — agree across all three adapters.

### Patch Changes

- 35e5f73: Lower the Array / String methods at their full JS arity, instead of only a single fixed argument count (#1448).

  Previously each `array-method` lowering (`join`, `includes`, `at`, `concat`, `slice`, `reverse`, `toReversed`, `toLowerCase`, `toUpperCase`, `trim`, …) accepted exactly one argument shape; any other arity slipped past the parser and fell through to a generic emit that built with no diagnostic and only crashed at SSR render time. Now:

  - **Zero-arg defaults are supported**: `arr.join()` uses the default `,` separator, `arr.slice()` returns a full copy, `arr.at()` is `arr.at(0)`, and `arr.concat()` is a shallow copy — matching JS, no more refusal/crash.
  - **JS-ignored trailing arguments are accepted**: `str.trim(1)`, `arr.at(i, extra)`, `arr.slice(s, e, extra)`, `arr.reverse(extra)`, etc. lower the same as their base form (JS ignores the extras too).
  - **Genuinely-meaningful extra arguments that aren't lowered yet still refuse with BF101** — the `fromIndex` of `.includes` / `.indexOf` / `.lastIndexOf` and the variadic `.concat(a, b, …)` — because silently dropping them would make the SSR output _differ_ from the client (worse than a build error). The diagnostic names the specific unsupported form and does **not** push `/* @client */` (the wrong remedy for an arity issue, and it can't be applied in attribute/condition position anyway).

- 9f6b711: Lower `String.prototype.padStart(target, pad?)` / `padEnd(target, pad?)` to the template-language adapters (#1448 Tier B).

  `value.padStart(5, '0')` / `value.padEnd(5, '.')` now compile to both template adapters, padding to the target width with the pad string (default a single space) repeated and truncated to fill. This completes the String Tier B set from #1448.

  - Parser: two new `array-method` variants `padStart` / `padEnd`, dropped from `UNSUPPORTED_METHODS`. Full JS arity: the no-argument form is `padStart(0)` → the receiver unchanged (JS coerces the missing target to 0), and a third+ argument is ignored. The adapter reads only target + padString.
  - Go: new `bf_pad_start` / `bf_pad_end` runtime helpers (shared `padTo`, rune-counted).
  - Mojo: new `bf->pad_start` / `bf->pad_end` helpers (shared `_pad`, character-counted).

  Length is measured in code points (Go runes / Perl chars) so the two adapters stay byte-equal; this differs from JS's UTF-16-unit `.length` only for astral-plane receivers, which are vanishingly rare in numeric / space padding. The target is truncated toward zero, and a receiver already at least `target` long (or an empty pad) is returned unchanged — all matching JS.

- bfac066: Lower `String.prototype.repeat(n)` to the template-language adapters (#1448 Tier B).

  `value.repeat(3)` now compiles to both template adapters (the receiver concatenated `n` times).

  - Parser: new `array-method` variant `repeat`, dropped from `UNSUPPORTED_METHODS`. Full JS arity: the no-argument form is `repeat(0)` → `""` (JS coerces the missing count to 0, not a `RangeError`), and a second+ argument is ignored.
  - Go: new `bf_repeat` runtime helper (`strings.Repeat`).
  - Mojo: new `bf->repeat` helper (Perl's `x` operator).

  JS throws `RangeError` for a negative count; both adapters instead clamp a count `<= 0` to the empty string so SSR templates degrade rather than crash the render, and truncate a fractional count toward zero (matching JS's `ToIntegerOrInfinity`). Go and Perl stay byte-equal.

- f6ab725: Lower the string-pattern form of `String.prototype.replace(pattern, replacement)` to the template-language adapters (#1448 Tier B).

  `value.replace('o', '0')` now compiles to both template adapters, replacing the **first** occurrence (JS string-pattern semantics — not `.replaceAll`).

  Full JS arity: a third+ argument is ignored (the adapter reads only the pattern + replacement). The one- and zero-argument forms are refused — JS coerces the missing replacement (and pattern) to the literal string `"undefined"`, a degenerate result (mirrors the `.includes()` / `.startsWith()` zero-arg refusal).

  - Parser: new `array-method` variant `replace`, dropped from `UNSUPPORTED_METHODS`. **Regex-pattern** `.replace(/…/, …)` stays refused with BF101 (the Perl `s///` vs Go `regexp.ReplaceAllString` flavour gap is the open design question), and `.replaceAll` stays refused entirely.
  - Go: new `bf_replace` runtime helper (`strings.Replace` with n=1).
  - Mojo: new `bf->replace` helper that splices via `index`/`substr` (not `s///`) so both the pattern and the replacement are literal.

  Known divergence (documented in `bf.go`, `BarefootJS.pm`): the replacement string is treated **literally** on both template adapters — special replacement patterns (`$&`, `$1`, …) are not interpreted. Go and Perl agree (byte-equal SSR output); this differs from the Hono/CSR JS path only for replacement strings containing `$`-patterns, which are rare in template position.

- a2c1810: Lower `String.prototype.split(sep)` to the template-language adapters (#1448 Tier B).

  `value.split(',')` now compiles to both template adapters instead of refusing with BF101. It's the first string method whose result is an _array_, so it composes with the existing array-method surface — `value.split(',').join('|')`, `value.split(',').map(...)`, `value.split(',').length`.

  - Parser: new `array-method` variant `split`; `split` drops out of `UNSUPPORTED_METHODS`.
  - Go: new `bf_split` runtime helper (wraps `strings.Split`, normalised to `[]any`).
  - Mojo: new `bf->split` helper that quotemetas the separator (literal-string match, not regex) and passes Perl's `split` a `-1` limit so trailing empty fields survive — keeping output byte-equal with Go and JS.

  Full JS arity: `.split()` (no separator) returns the whole string as a single element, `.split(sep)` splits on the literal separator, and `.split(sep, limit)` caps the number of pieces (matching JS — `limit` 0 → empty, negative / `>=` length → all); a third+ argument is ignored. The regex-separator form stays refused (a regex-literal argument parses as `unsupported` and propagates to BF101 — the per-adapter regex-flavour decision is tracked for `.replace`). Verified byte-equal across Hono/CSR, Go, and Mojo.

- 9cf0a27: Lower `String.prototype.startsWith(prefix)` / `endsWith(suffix)` to the template-language adapters (#1448 Tier B).

  `value.startsWith('a')` / `value.endsWith('z')` now compile to both template adapters instead of refusing with BF101. Both return a boolean, so they slot naturally into condition position (`value.startsWith(p) ? … : …`).

  Full JS arity: the optional `position` (`startsWith`) / `endPosition` (`endsWith`) second argument re-anchors the test, clamped to `[0, length]` so it never crashes — `"hello world".startsWith("world", 6)` and `"hello world".endsWith("hello", 5)` both lower. A third+ argument is ignored. The zero-arg form (`.startsWith()`) is refused: JS coerces the missing search to the literal string `"undefined"`, a degenerate result (mirrors the `.includes()` zero-arg refusal). Verified byte-equal across Hono/CSR, Go, and Mojo.

  - Parser: two new `array-method` variants `startsWith` / `endsWith`, dropped from `UNSUPPORTED_METHODS`.
  - Go: new `bf_starts_with` / `bf_ends_with` runtime helpers (`strings.HasPrefix` / `strings.HasSuffix`, with the optional clamped position).
  - Mojo: new `bf->starts_with` / `bf->ends_with` helpers doing a `substr`-anchored literal comparison (no regex metachar surprises), with the optional clamped position and empty-prefix/suffix + undef-receiver handling matching JS and Go.

### Patch Changes

- a4f818d: Rewrite the Mojolicious adapter's expression lowering to be parse-first, matching the Go adapter.

  `convertExpressionToPerl` now parses every expression once, gates it on the shared `isSupported`, and renders supported shapes through the AST emitter (`renderParsedExprToPerl`) — the same flow as the Go adapter's `convertExpressionToGo`. The per-method routing regexes, the regex string-rewriting pipeline, `convertHigherOrderExpr`, and `rewriteTemplatePrimitives` are all removed (net −229 lines). The parser's `UNSUPPORTED_METHODS` is now the single source of truth for what is refused, so no adapter-side method-name list has to be kept in sync.

  The AST emitter (`MojoTopLevelEmitter`) gains the handling the regex pipeline previously did: `props.x → $x` flattening, identifier-path templatePrimitive calls (`JSON.stringify` / `Math.floor` → `bf->json` / `bf->floor`), top-level template literals, and a BF101 refusal for the still-unsupported `.find` / `.findIndex` / `.findLast` / `.findLastIndex` Mojo gap. No behaviour change: the full Mojo unit suite and the perl-rendering conformance suite pass unchanged.

- dd2988d: Lower JS `===`/`!==` to Perl `eq`/`ne` when an operand is string-typed — a string signal getter (`sel()`) or a string prop (`props.x`), not only a string literal (#1672). Perl's numeric `==` coerces non-numeric strings to 0, so `"b" == "a"` was true and a whole-item loop conditional like `items().map(t => sel() === t.id && …)` rendered every item's true branch server-side. This unblocks the `loop-item-conditional` conformance fixture on Mojo.
- dff7704: Raise BF101 at build time for unsupported `String.prototype` methods on the template-language adapters (#1448 follow-up).

  Methods that have no SSR lowering — `split`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `replace`, `replaceAll`, `repeat`, `padStart`, `padEnd`, `charAt`, `charCodeAt`, `codePointAt`, `normalize`, `substring`, `substr`, `match`, `matchAll`, `search` — were previously absent from the `UNSUPPORTED_METHODS` gate, so `isSupported` reported them supported and the Go / Mojolicious adapters emitted an invalid raw method call (`{{.Name.StartsWith "a"}}` / `$name->{startsWith}('a')`) that produced no build diagnostic and only crashed at template-render time.

  They now surface BF101 with an actionable `/* @client */` suggestion (parity with the unsupported array methods), and the adapter degrades to a safe empty slot instead of emitting template that fails at render. The Mojo adapter routes these through the AST path so the shared `isSupported` gate fires rather than the regex pipeline mangling them. The `/* @client */` escape hatch continues to work for any of these expressions.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 113a17c: Reactive whole-item conditionals in loops (#1665).

  `arr.map(t => cond(t) && <li/>)` (and `cond ? <li/> : null`, `expr || <li/>`,
  `expr ?? <li/>`) makes the conditional the entire loop item, so an item renders
  0-or-1 element per pass. Previously this either threw at hydration (the loop's
  children stayed empty and the whole `.map(...)` was emitted verbatim as
  reactive text — uncompiled inline JSX, undeclared module-level helpers) or, once
  compiled, crashed at runtime (`firstElementChild.cloneNode` on a null element)
  or froze at its server-rendered value.

  This is now fully reactive, with identical behaviour whether the array is a
  `const` or a `signal()`:

  - **Runtime** — new `mapArrayAnchored` tracks each item by an always-present
    `<!--bf-loop-i:KEY-->` anchor comment (not a root element, which the item may
    not have); content lives between the anchor and the next anchor / loop end and
    is derived from the live DOM range each pass. `insert()` accepts the anchor as
    its scope so a whole-item conditional toggles range-scoped to its own item.
  - **Compiler** — detect the whole-item conditional, hoist the key from the
    rendering branch, emit per-item anchors plus a `mapArrayAnchored` renderItem;
    static-array bodies route through the same path. Logical (`&&`/`||`/`??`) and
    ternary JSX-helper map bodies are inlined, and BF023 now requires a key on
    those bodies.
  - **SSR adapters** — Hono, Go, and Mojo emit the per-item `bf-loop-i:KEY` anchor
    so server-rendered lists hydrate. Hono also emits `data-key` on the
    conditional branch's loop-item root, matching Go / CSR.

  Both-branch-element ternaries (`cond ? <A/> : <B/>`) render exactly one element
  and keep their existing `mapArray` path.

### Patch Changes

- 5cf7272: Emit `barefoot-importmap.html` for template-string adapters (#1644).

  Follow-up to #1639/#1641. The externals system writes `barefoot-externals.json`
  for every adapter, but the Go html/template and Mojolicious adapters had no
  equivalent of Hono's `BfImportMap` component, so a project configuring
  `externals` there had nowhere to inject the importmap + preloads.

  - `bf build` now emits a ready-to-include `barefoot-importmap.html` snippet
    (generated from the same manifest) alongside `barefoot-externals.json` for
    template-string adapters. Include it via `{{ template "barefoot-importmap.html" . }}`
    (Go) or `%= include 'barefoot-importmap'` (Mojolicious).
  - Add `TemplateAdapter.importMapInjection` (`'component' | 'html-snippet'`) so an
    adapter declares how it exposes the importmap. Hono is `'component'` (no
    snippet emitted); Go/Mojo are `'html-snippet'`.
  - New `renderImportMapHtml` + `ExternalsManifest` exports from `@barefootjs/jsx`
    (and a zero-dependency `@barefootjs/jsx/import-map` subpath) are the single
    source of truth for the snippet HTML. Hono's `BfImportMap` now delegates to it
    so the component and snippet paths cannot drift — the snippet inherits Hono's
    `crossorigin` modulepreload fix (#1648) and the `<`-escaped importmap JSON.
  - New cross-adapter `assertImportMapInjectionContract` in `@barefootjs/adapter-tests`
    fails if a new adapter ships without an importmap injection point, and now also
    asserts parity: the external must resolve _through_ the importmap and every
    `modulepreload` hint must carry `crossorigin`.

- c03e0d9: Fix the Mojo test renderer (`renderMojoComponent`) so a child component that destructures a rest-spread bag (`function NativeSelect({ children, ...props })`) renders instead of dying on an undeclared `$props`. `buildChildRenderers` now defaults the rest-props identifier to an empty hashref when the caller doesn't supply one, matching the production runtime's manifest-driven `isRestProps` plumbing (#1652).
- d13dc5c: Widen `.sort()` / `.toSorted()` comparator lowering with multi-key, relational-ternary, and block-body shapes (#1448 Tier B follow-up).

  The comparator parser now builds a structured `SortComparator` as a `keys: SortKey[]` list and accepts three previously-refused shapes (each lowering to both template-language adapters + the Hono/CSR JS path):

  - **Multi-key (`||`-chain)** — `(a, b) => a.x - b.x || a.y.localeCompare(b.y)` splits into one comparison key per `||` operand, applied in priority order as tie-breaks. Emits one 4-string `bf_sort` group (Go) / one `keys` hash (Mojo) per key.
  - **Relational ternary** — `(a, b) => a.f > b.f ? 1 : -1`, the 3-way `a.f < b.f ? -1 : a.f > b.f ? 1 : 0`, and the leading-tie `a.f === b.f ? 0 : …` forms lower to a new `auto` compare type: numeric when both keys parse as numbers, else lexical. Both template runtimes share this rule so their output stays byte-equal (diverges from JS `<`/`>` only for numeric strings).
  - **Single-`return` block bodies** — `(a, b) => { return a.f - b.f }` (arrow form; the function-expression form already worked) unwrap to the returned comparator.

  Runtime: Go `bf_sort` is now variadic over 4-string key groups with an `auto` branch; Mojo `bf->sort` takes an ordered `keys` list with the same `auto` rule. Function-reference comparators (`sort(myCmp)`), multi-statement block bodies, and `localeCompare(b, locale, opts)` stay refused (BF021) — deferred follow-ups.

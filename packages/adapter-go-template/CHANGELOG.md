### Patch Changes

- 113a17c: Reactive whole-item conditionals in loops (#1665).

  `arr.map(t => cond(t) && <li/>)` (and `cond ? <li/> : null`, `expr || <li/>`,
  `expr ?? <li/>`) makes the conditional the entire loop item, so an item renders
  0-or-1 element per pass. Previously this either threw at hydration (the loop's
  children stayed empty and the whole `.map(...)` was emitted verbatim as
  reactive text — uncompiled inline JSX, undeclared module-level helpers) or, once
  compiled, crashed at runtime (`firstElementChild.cloneNode` on a null element)
  or froze at its server-rendered value.

  This is now fully reactive, with identical behaviour whether the array is a
  `const` or a `signal()`:

  - **Runtime** — new `mapArrayAnchored` tracks each item by an always-present
    `<!--bf-loop-i:KEY-->` anchor comment (not a root element, which the item may
    not have); content lives between the anchor and the next anchor / loop end and
    is derived from the live DOM range each pass. `insert()` accepts the anchor as
    its scope so a whole-item conditional toggles range-scoped to its own item.
  - **Compiler** — detect the whole-item conditional, hoist the key from the
    rendering branch, emit per-item anchors plus a `mapArrayAnchored` renderItem;
    static-array bodies route through the same path. Logical (`&&`/`||`/`??`) and
    ternary JSX-helper map bodies are inlined, and BF023 now requires a key on
    those bodies.
  - **SSR adapters** — Hono, Go, and Mojo emit the per-item `bf-loop-i:KEY` anchor
    so server-rendered lists hydrate. Hono also emits `data-key` on the
    conditional branch's loop-item root, matching Go / CSR.

  Both-branch-element ternaries (`cond ? <A/> : <B/>`) render exactly one element
  and keep their existing `mapArray` path.

### Patch Changes

- 5cf7272: Emit `barefoot-importmap.html` for template-string adapters (#1644).

  Follow-up to #1639/#1641. The externals system writes `barefoot-externals.json`
  for every adapter, but the Go html/template and Mojolicious adapters had no
  equivalent of Hono's `BfImportMap` component, so a project configuring
  `externals` there had nowhere to inject the importmap + preloads.

  - `bf build` now emits a ready-to-include `barefoot-importmap.html` snippet
    (generated from the same manifest) alongside `barefoot-externals.json` for
    template-string adapters. Include it via `{{ template "barefoot-importmap.html" . }}`
    (Go) or `%= include 'barefoot-importmap'` (Mojolicious).
  - Add `TemplateAdapter.importMapInjection` (`'component' | 'html-snippet'`) so an
    adapter declares how it exposes the importmap. Hono is `'component'` (no
    snippet emitted); Go/Mojo are `'html-snippet'`.
  - New `renderImportMapHtml` + `ExternalsManifest` exports from `@barefootjs/jsx`
    (and a zero-dependency `@barefootjs/jsx/import-map` subpath) are the single
    source of truth for the snippet HTML. Hono's `BfImportMap` now delegates to it
    so the component and snippet paths cannot drift — the snippet inherits Hono's
    `crossorigin` modulepreload fix (#1648) and the `<`-escaped importmap JSON.
  - New cross-adapter `assertImportMapInjectionContract` in `@barefootjs/adapter-tests`
    fails if a new adapter ships without an importmap injection point, and now also
    asserts parity: the external must resolve _through_ the importmap and every
    `modulepreload` hint must carry `crossorigin`.

- d13dc5c: Widen `.sort()` / `.toSorted()` comparator lowering with multi-key, relational-ternary, and block-body shapes (#1448 Tier B follow-up).

  The comparator parser now builds a structured `SortComparator` as a `keys: SortKey[]` list and accepts three previously-refused shapes (each lowering to both template-language adapters + the Hono/CSR JS path):

  - **Multi-key (`||`-chain)** — `(a, b) => a.x - b.x || a.y.localeCompare(b.y)` splits into one comparison key per `||` operand, applied in priority order as tie-breaks. Emits one 4-string `bf_sort` group (Go) / one `keys` hash (Mojo) per key.
  - **Relational ternary** — `(a, b) => a.f > b.f ? 1 : -1`, the 3-way `a.f < b.f ? -1 : a.f > b.f ? 1 : 0`, and the leading-tie `a.f === b.f ? 0 : …` forms lower to a new `auto` compare type: numeric when both keys parse as numbers, else lexical. Both template runtimes share this rule so their output stays byte-equal (diverges from JS `<`/`>` only for numeric strings).
  - **Single-`return` block bodies** — `(a, b) => { return a.f - b.f }` (arrow form; the function-expression form already worked) unwrap to the returned comparator.

  Runtime: Go `bf_sort` is now variadic over 4-string key groups with an `auto` branch; Mojo `bf->sort` takes an ordered `keys` list with the same `auto` rule. Function-reference comparators (`sort(myCmp)`), multi-statement block bodies, and `localeCompare(b, locale, opts)` stay refused (BF021) — deferred follow-ups.

### Patch Changes

- 91523ba: Add .findLast(p) / .findLastIndex(p) higher-order method lowering (#1448 Tier B). Go template adapter lowers via bf_find_last / bf_find_last_index runtime helpers (equality predicates) and range-based template blocks (complex predicates). Mojo adapter refuses with BF101 (matching existing find/findIndex gap).
- e16730d: Fix nullish coalescing (`??`) branch selection for unset props: map JS `null` to Go `nil` instead of empty string so `{{if ne .Field nil}}` correctly evaluates to false when the field is unset.
- 85d0507: Hoist preambles for template-block composition in expressions: when a higher-order method with a complex predicate (findLast, findLastIndex, every, some) is composed inside binary/logical/conditional expressions, the template block is structurally split into a preamble and a variable reference so the output is valid Go template syntax. Migrate all template-block producers (findLast, findLastIndex, every, some) from fixed $bf_result to counter-based unique variable names ($bf_r0, $bf_r1, ...) to avoid redeclaration conflicts when multiple blocks are composed.

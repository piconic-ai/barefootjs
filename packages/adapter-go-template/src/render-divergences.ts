/**
 * Render-level divergences against the shared conformance corpus
 * (Priority-12 edge-case sweep, #2168): fixtures that COMPILE clean on
 * this adapter but whose rendered output diverges from the Hono
 * reference on real Go — or whose generated Go fails `go run` outright
 * (marked "exit 1" below; those should eventually become loud BF101
 * refusals instead of broken codegen).
 *
 * Consumed by this package's conformance test (its `skipJsx` set is
 * derived from these keys, so the skip list and this declaration can't
 * drift) and by `packages/compat`, which publishes the entries in the
 * fixture-divergences section of `ui/compat.lock.json` — surfaced on
 * the docs compatibility-matrix page. Graduating an entry means fixing
 * the adapter (or the shared compiler layer) and deleting the line.

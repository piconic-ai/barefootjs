### Patch Changes

- 6b3bba3: Lower value-producing `.map(cb)` on the template-string adapters via the #2018 runtime evaluator (#2073). A `.map()` whose callback returns a value (the blog-showcase shape `` p.tags.map((t) => `#${t}`).join(' ') ``) previously refused with BF101 on Go / Mojo / Xslate; `map` now joins `CALLBACK_METHODS`, the projection body serializes per element through the new `map_eval` helpers (`bf->map_eval` / `$bf.map_eval` / `bf_map_eval` + `BarefootJS::Evaluator::map_json` / Go `MapEval`), one result per element with no flatten, composing through the existing `.join` lowering. The JSX-returning `.map` is an IRLoop upstream and unaffected; the fall-throughs (a bare `arr.map` reference or a function-reference callback) still refuse loudly.
- 882847c: SSR-compute memos derived from the `createSearchParams()` env signal (#2075), building on the #1922 per-request readers — including LIST-valued filter memos on Go. Env-signal handling is now open-closed: a new `ENV_SIGNAL_READERS` registry in `@barefootjs/jsx` (`envSignalReaderFor` / `envSignalLocalNames`) supplies the canonical reader name and method set, so a future env signal registers once instead of growing per-adapter branches. Mojo/Xslate seed derived memos in-template from the registry-resolved canonical reader (aliased getters canonicalise), with the seed-availability check allowing lowering-internal bindings (arrow/lambda params, Perl's `$_`, Kolon's `$bf`). Go lowers scalar derived memos (`get('k')` bare and `?? '<lit>'` defaulted) and list-filter memos (`props.items.filter(p => …tag()…)` → `bf.FilterEval` with the predicate's getter calls materialized into the env) in the generated constructor, typing filter memos `[]any`. The runtime evaluator gains its first `array-method` — `.includes` (array SameValueZero membership / string substring) — implemented isomorphically in Go and Perl and pinned by new golden vectors; `.every`/`.some` predicates using `.includes` now route through the evaluator on the Perl adapters too. The pre-existing template-position helpers (`bf_includes`, `$bf->includes`) now share the same SameValueZero equality — previously Go used `reflect.DeepEqual` (int/float64 never matched, `[NaN].includes(NaN)` was false) and Perl used stringy `eq` (`[2].includes("2")` was wrongly true) — so `.includes` returns the JS answer regardless of position.

### Minor Changes

- 59b4efc: `queryHref` SSR parity for the Mojolicious and Xslate adapters (#2042).

  `queryHref(base, { … })` now lowers to a `query` runtime helper on the Perl adapters, matching the go-template `bf_query` lowering shipped in #2044:

  - **Mojolicious** lowers it to `bf->query(base, …)`, **Xslate** to `$bf.query(base, …)`. Each object property becomes a `(guard, key, value)` triple; the helper includes a pair iff its guard is truthy AND its value is a non-empty string — so a plain `key: v` passes guard `1`, and a conditional `key: cond ? v : undefined` passes the lowered condition (mirroring the client's `if (value)`).
  - A new `query` helper in the shared Perl runtime (`BarefootJS.pm`) builds the URL with `URLSearchParams.set` overwrite semantics and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding (space → `+`, UTF-8 byte-wise), so the rendered query string equals the browser / Hono render byte-for-byte.
  - `@barefootjs/jsx` gains a backend-neutral `matchQueryHrefCall` / `queryHrefArgs` helper shared by the SSR adapters' lowering.

  Recognition handles aliased imports and both the `@barefootjs/client` and `@barefootjs/client/runtime` entry points. A non-literal params object falls back to the generic lowering.

- caba215: `queryHref` now accepts an **array value** for multi-value query keys (#2048, the Q4 follow-up to #2042): `queryHref(base, { tag: ['a', 'b'] })` → `?tag=a&tag=b`, i.e. `URLSearchParams.append` rather than `set`. Empty / falsy members are skipped (same truthy-omit as a scalar), so an empty — or all-empty — array contributes nothing. `QueryParamValue` becomes `string | string[] | null | undefined`.

  This works across the client and all SSR adapters byte-for-byte:

  - **`@barefootjs/client`**: `queryHref` appends each non-empty array member.
  - **`@barefootjs/perl`** (Mojolicious + Xslate via the shared `query` helper): an array ref appends one pair per non-empty member.
  - **`@barefootjs/go-template`**: `bf_query` appends each non-empty member of a `[]string` (or `[]any`) value. To support this, the value-emptiness check moved from the lowering into the `bf_query` helper itself — a plain `key: v` now lowers to a `(true)` include and a conditional to `(cond)`, and the helper drops an included-but-empty value. This matches the client and Perl exactly (it also removes the previous Go-only divergence where an explicitly-included empty value was kept as `k=`); rendered output for existing scalar usage is unchanged.

  The `query` helper's array behaviour is conformance-tested across the Go and Perl backends via the shared golden helper vectors.

### Patch Changes

- b57ed47: Lower `.flatMap(proj)` through the runtime evaluator (#2018, P3). The projection
  body serializes to a ParsedExpr JSON blob and `bf_flat_map_eval` /
  `bf->flat_map_eval` / `$bf.flat_map_eval` projects each element then flattens
  one level, generalizing the structured self / field / tuple
  (`bf_flat_map` / `bf_flat_map_tuple`) catalogue to any pure projection. A
  projection the evaluator can't model falls back to the structured helper. The
  shared runtime gains `BarefootJS::Evaluator::flat_map` / `flat_map_json` and a
  `flat_map_eval` controller helper (Go `FlatMapEval`, registered as
  `bf_flat_map_eval`). Rendered HTML is unchanged; only the emitted template text
  moves to the evaluator helper. (`.flat(depth?)` is a non-callback array method
  and stays folded.)
- 39fc2ea: Lower standalone `.sort(cmp)` / `.reduce(fn, init)` on the Mojolicious and
  Xslate adapters through the runtime evaluator (#2018, P1 — the Perl half of the
  Go change). The comparator / reducer body is serialized to a ParsedExpr JSON
  blob and evaluated per element by the new `bf->sort_eval` / `bf->reduce_eval`
  (`$bf.sort_eval` / `$bf.reduce_eval` in Xslate) helpers, with captured free
  variables threaded as a `base_env` hashref — generalizing the fixed `bf->sort` /
  `bf->reduce` catalogues to any pure comparator / reducer body. A comparator the
  evaluator can't model (e.g. `localeCompare`) falls back to the legacy `bf->sort`
  path, so behavior there is unchanged. The shared Perl runtime gains
  `BarefootJS::Evaluator::fold_json` / `sort_by_json` (the JSON-string seam the
  templates emit into) and the `sort_eval` / `reduce_eval` controller helpers.
  Rendered HTML is unchanged; only the emitted template text moves to the
  evaluator helpers. The chained `.sort().map()` / `.filter().map()` loop-hoist
  keeps the legacy path until its own phase (P3).
- 6147144: Lower higher-order methods (`.filter` / `.find` / `.findIndex` / `.findLast` /
  `.findLastIndex` / `.every` / `.some`) on the Mojolicious and Xslate adapters
  through the runtime evaluator (#2018, P2 — the Perl half of the Go change). The
  predicate body serializes to a ParsedExpr JSON blob and emits
  `bf->filter_eval` / `bf->find_eval` / `bf->find_index_eval` / `bf->every_eval` /
  `bf->some_eval` (`$bf.…` in Xslate), with captured free vars threaded as a
  `base_env` hashref — the same JS-faithful evaluator the Go adapter uses, so the
  two SSR backends stay byte-isomorphic. A predicate the evaluator can't model
  (e.g. a method-call predicate) falls back to the inline `grep` / Kolon-lambda /
  `bf->find` lowering, and `.filter(Boolean)` keeps its inline truthiness form.

  The shared `BarefootJS` runtime gains `filter_eval` / `every_eval` / `some_eval`
  / `find_eval` / `find_index_eval` controller helpers, delegating to the
  `BarefootJS::Evaluator` predicate helpers. Rendered HTML is unchanged; only the
  emitted template text moves to the evaluator helpers.

### Minor Changes

- 8d2cbe8: `searchParams()` (router v0.5) now renders at SSR on the Mojolicious and Xslate template adapters, so the cross-adapter `search-params` conformance fixture (`{searchParams().get('sort') ?? 'none'}`) runs on Perl too instead of being skipped (#1922, follow-up to the Go support).

  - **Lowering** (`@barefootjs/jsx` shared helpers `importsSearchParams` / `matchSearchParamsMethodCall`, consumed by both Perl adapters): `searchParams().get(k)` is recognised as an env-signal method call and lowered to a real method call on the per-request reader — `$searchParams->get('sort')` (Mojo) / `$searchParams.get('sort')` (Xslate) — instead of the broken generic deref (`$searchParams->{get}` / `$searchParams.get`, which dropped the call + argument). Scoped to components that import `searchParams` from `@barefootjs/client`.
  - **Runtime** (`@barefootjs/perl`): new `BarefootJS::SearchParams` — a core-Perl, framework-agnostic reader. `new($query)` parses an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` query (leading `?`, `+`/`%XX` decoding tolerated); `get($key)` returns the first value, or `undef` when absent. Because the adapters lower `??` to Perl's defined-or `//` (which coalesces only `undef`), this matches JS `??` exactly — an absent key falls back to the author's default while a present-but-empty value (`?sort=`) keeps the empty string (a closer match than the Go adapter, whose `or` lowering also coalesces `''`).
  - **Mojolicious wiring** (`@barefootjs/mojolicious`): the plugin's `before_render` hook seeds the `$searchParams` template var per request from `$c->req->query_params`, so `searchParams()` resolves the live query during SSR (the client re-reads `window.location` on hydration). A caller-set value wins (`//=`).
  - **Xslate**: the backend is framework-agnostic, so the host passes a `searchParams => BarefootJS::SearchParams->new($query)` template var (the conformance harness seeds an empty-query reader; production hosts thread their request query).

- 6547370: Variable element-access + `.toFixed`, and `/* @client */`-guarded memo SSR folding (#1897, data-table):

  - `@barefootjs/jsx`: new `index-access` `ParsedExpr` kind for element access with a non-literal index (`selected()[index]`, `rows[i + 1]`). Previously refused as "Complex computed property access"; now supported and dispatched through a new `ParsedExprEmitter.indexAccess` arm. The Perl adapters disambiguate array (`->[$i]`) from hash (`->{$k}`) deref by the index's type; Xslate/Hono use the language's polymorphic `[]`; Go emits the `index` builtin.
  - `@barefootjs/jsx`: `.toFixed(digits?)` lowers as a new `array-method` across all adapters — `bf->to_fixed` / `$bf.to_fixed` (new Perl runtime helper), `bf_to_fixed` (new Go runtime helper, `fmt.Sprintf("%.*f", …)`), native `.toFixed` on Hono.
  - `@barefootjs/jsx`: `extractSsrDefaults` now folds a block-body memo through a statically-resolvable `if (cond) return …` guard, so a `/* @client */`-guarded memo (`const key = sortKey(); if (!key) return rows; … sort …`) seeds its default-state early-return value instead of `null`.
  - `@barefootjs/mojolicious`: the test harness seeds a root signal whose initial is `null` / unevaluable as `undef` (rather than skipping it), so a getter read only in a child-prop expression doesn't fault strict vars.

  With these, the composed `data-table` demo compiles clean on both Perl adapters and renders structurally byte-identical to Hono on real Mojolicious / Text::Xslate. It stays pinned in `skipJsx` on a single remaining divergence — the scope-ID of imported components inside the keyed `.map` (a hydration-scope concern tracked with #1896), not an expression-lowering gap.

### Patch Changes

- 1f8b1e0: Nested `render_child` calls now resolve and carry correct slot identity. Two fixes (#1897):

  - A child template rendering another imported component (AccordionTrigger → ChevronDownIcon) executed against a fresh `BarefootJS` instance whose child-renderer registry started empty — the registry is now shared with each child instance (test harnesses + `register_components_from_manifest`).
  - `render_child` now invokes the renderer as `$renderer->($props, $invoking_bf)`, and renderer closures derive the child's scope/slot identity from the caller's scope id instead of the registrant's. A grandchild now mounts as `root_s0_s0` rather than collapsing to `root_s0` and colliding `(host, slot)` pairs (#1249 slot-identity contract). Renderer contract note: unpack `@_` (`my ($props, $caller) = @_;`) — a one-argument subroutine signature (`sub ($props)`) enforces arity and will die on the second argument.

### Patch Changes

- 03c7a3c: Propagate SSR context (`<Ctx.Provider value>` → `useContext`) on the Mojolicious and Text::Xslate adapters, graduating the `context-provider` conformance fixture to Hono parity.

  Both adapters previously emitted a child template that read an un-seeded consumer variable (`$theme`), so the provider value never reached the descendant — the fixture was skipped (Go already implemented this in #1768; the Perl side was a deferred follow-up).

  The Perl runtime now mirrors the client `provideContext` / `useContext`:

  - `BarefootJS.pm` gains `provide_context` / `revoke_context` / `use_context`, backed by a package-level value stack. SSR rendering is synchronous and the provider's push/pop are perfectly balanced, so the stack always unwinds at the end of each provider subtree — and a package global (rather than `$c->stash` or the backend) is the one store reliably shared between a parent template and the child templates it renders via `render_child` (the Xslate backend runs with `c => undef`; the Mojo path lazily builds a backend per instance).
  - **Mojo**: `emitProvider` brackets the children with `<% bf->provide_context('Ctx', <value>); %>` … `<% bf->revoke_context('Ctx'); %>`, and each `useContext` consumer is seeded with `% my $x = bf->use_context('Ctx', <default>);`.
  - **Xslate**: same, using the inline `<: $bf.provide_context(...) :>` / `<: $bf.revoke_context(...) :>` form (both return `''`, so the interpolation emits nothing) and a `: my $x = $bf.use_context('Ctx', <default>);` line-statement seed.

  Verified end-to-end against real Mojolicious and Text::Xslate. Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

- 42e0ed9: Graduate the `toggle-shared` conformance fixture to Hono parity on the Mojolicious and Text::Xslate adapters — a keyed `.map` of sibling `ToggleItem` children, each with a per-item prop-derived signal. Three gaps were closed (#1297):

  1. **Prop-derived signal SSR seeding.** A signal whose init derives from a prop (`createSignal(props.defaultOn ?? false)`) is now seeded in-template from the passed prop (`% my $on = ($defaultOn // 0);` / `: my $on = ($defaultOn // 0);`), so a loop child honours its own per-item prop instead of the static default. The lowering is gated by `isSupported` (object/array/constant inits never reach `convertExpression*`, so they don't record a spurious BF101 and keep their existing ssr-defaults seeding) and skipped on Text::Xslate for a same-name signal (Kolon can't express `: my $x = … $x …`; those stay on the harness/manifest seeding, which already resolves them from the prop).

  2. **Loop-child scope id.** A loop child now gets a fresh `<ComponentName>_<rand>` scope id (the PascalCase component name) instead of a parent-slot id, matching the Hono reference (`normalizeHTML` canonicalises `<ComponentName>_<rand>` → `<ComponentName>_*`).

  3. **`data-key`.** The JSX `key` (a reserved prop) now lands as `data-key="…"` on the child scope root, for keyed-loop reconciliation parity. `BarefootJS.pm` gains a `_data_key` field + `data_key_attr` helper; `render_child` sets it from the `key` prop; the component root emits it (`bf->data_key_attr` / `$bf.data_key_attr()`), so non-keyed renders add nothing.

  Note: prop-derived signals/memos are now computed in-template from the props they derive from, so a host seeds the _prop_ (e.g. `initial`) rather than the signal value directly. Verified end-to-end against real Mojolicious and Text::Xslate. Hono reference snapshots unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 848896b: Add `runAdapterConformanceTests` for the Text::Xslate adapter (with a
  `renderXslateComponent` test renderer), validated against the same shared
  fixture corpus as mojo.

  Make the adapter's runtime-helper calls consistent: every JS-semantics-sensitive
  value operation goes through a `$bf` method, so the runtime's JS-compat handling
  is always applied (rather than a raw Kolon builtin). `.filter` / `.every` /
  `.some` / `.find` / `.findIndex` / `.findLast` / `.findLastIndex`,
  `.toLowerCase` / `.toUpperCase`, `.join`, and `.length` lower to the
  corresponding `$bf` methods — new methods
  on the `BarefootJS` runtime in `@barefootjs/perl`. This also fixes a latent bug:
  `.length` previously used Kolon's array-only `.size()`, which faults on a string;
  `$bf.length` handles both arrays (element count) and strings (char count).

  The skip list is verified, not inherited: the six fixtures mojo skips for
  Perl-EP scoping faults (`logical-or-jsx`, `nullish-coalescing-jsx`,
  `branch-map`, `return-logical-or`, `return-nullish-coalescing`, `return-map`)
  all PASS on Xslate, because Kolon resolves variables from the per-render vars
  rather than Perl lexicals. `style-object-dynamic` is pinned as a `BF101`
  diagnostic (a clean refusal) rather than skipped. Eight fixtures remain skipped
  (SSR context, multi-component scope-id harness, Phase-2b `site/ui` primitives),
  each confirmed to genuinely fail.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 3ed9659: Add `BarefootJS::DevReload` — framework-agnostic dev browser auto-reload. The
  shared module provides the browser snippet, the `<dist>/.dev/build-id` reader,
  and a ready-made PSGI streaming app (`->to_app`) for the SSE endpoint, so plain
  PSGI/Plack hosts (e.g. the Text::Xslate backend) get the same `barefoot build
--watch` auto-reload as Mojolicious. `Mojolicious::Plugin::BarefootJS::DevReload`
  now delegates its snippet and build-id logic to the shared module (no behaviour
  change).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ac91bc6: Extract the engine-agnostic Perl runtime (`BarefootJS.pm`) into a new
  `@barefootjs/perl` package. `@barefootjs/mojolicious` now depends on it and
  keeps only the Mojo-specific pieces — `BarefootJS::Backend::Mojo`, the
  `Mojolicious::Plugin::BarefootJS` binding, and the compile-time adapter that
  emits Embedded Perl (`.html.ep`).

  The runtime is Mojo-free at load time and drives any Perl template engine
  through a pluggable backend (`encode_json` / `mark_raw` / `materialize` /
  `render_named`), with an injectable JSON encoder. SSR output is unchanged for
  the Mojolicious path.

  Note for consumers that wire Perl `@INC` by hand: `BarefootJS.pm` now ships in
  `@barefootjs/perl/lib` rather than `@barefootjs/mojolicious/lib`. Point `@INC`
  at both package `lib/` directories (the Mojolicious integration's build does
  this automatically).

- 199644e: Add `@barefootjs/xslate` — a Text::Xslate (Kolon) adapter that compiles
  BarefootJS IR to `.tx` templates and ships `BarefootJS::Backend::Xslate`. Because
  the rendering backend is framework-agnostic, it runs under any PSGI/Plack app
  (no Mojolicious required). Validated end-to-end against Text::Xslate 3.5.9 and
  served live via Plack.

  The EP→Kolon mapping is mechanical (`<%= X %>` → `<: X :>`, `<%== X %>` →
  `<: X | mark_raw :>`, `bf->m` → `$bf.m()`), so the engine-agnostic
  `BarefootJS` runtime renders through Xslate unchanged.

  Also generalizes the core `render_child` (in `@barefootjs/perl`) to accept the
  single-hashref call form that Text::Xslate Kolon (and Template Toolkit) method
  calls require, in addition to the existing Mojo list form. Backward-compatible.

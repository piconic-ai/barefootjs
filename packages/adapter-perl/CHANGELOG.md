## 0.9.1

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 848896b: Add `runAdapterConformanceTests` for the Text::Xslate adapter (with a
  `renderXslateComponent` test renderer), validated against the same shared
  fixture corpus as mojo.

  Make the adapter's runtime-helper calls consistent: every JS-semantics-sensitive
  value operation goes through a `$bf` method, so the runtime's JS-compat handling
  is always applied (rather than a raw Kolon builtin). `.filter` / `.every` /
  `.some` / `.find` / `.findIndex` / `.findLast` / `.findLastIndex`,
  `.toLowerCase` / `.toUpperCase`, `.join`, and `.length` lower to the
  corresponding `$bf` methods — new methods
  on the `BarefootJS` runtime in `@barefootjs/perl`. This also fixes a latent bug:
  `.length` previously used Kolon's array-only `.size()`, which faults on a string;
  `$bf.length` handles both arrays (element count) and strings (char count).

  The skip list is verified, not inherited: the six fixtures mojo skips for
  Perl-EP scoping faults (`logical-or-jsx`, `nullish-coalescing-jsx`,
  `branch-map`, `return-logical-or`, `return-nullish-coalescing`, `return-map`)
  all PASS on Xslate, because Kolon resolves variables from the per-render vars
  rather than Perl lexicals. `style-object-dynamic` is pinned as a `BF101`
  diagnostic (a clean refusal) rather than skipped. Eight fixtures remain skipped
  (SSR context, multi-component scope-id harness, Phase-2b `site/ui` primitives),
  each confirmed to genuinely fail.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 3ed9659: Add `BarefootJS::DevReload` — framework-agnostic dev browser auto-reload. The
  shared module provides the browser snippet, the `<dist>/.dev/build-id` reader,
  and a ready-made PSGI streaming app (`->to_app`) for the SSE endpoint, so plain
  PSGI/Plack hosts (e.g. the Text::Xslate backend) get the same `barefoot build
--watch` auto-reload as Mojolicious. `Mojolicious::Plugin::BarefootJS::DevReload`
  now delegates its snippet and build-id logic to the shared module (no behaviour
  change).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ac91bc6: Extract the engine-agnostic Perl runtime (`BarefootJS.pm`) into a new
  `@barefootjs/perl` package. `@barefootjs/mojolicious` now depends on it and
  keeps only the Mojo-specific pieces — `BarefootJS::Backend::Mojo`, the
  `Mojolicious::Plugin::BarefootJS` binding, and the compile-time adapter that
  emits Embedded Perl (`.html.ep`).

  The runtime is Mojo-free at load time and drives any Perl template engine
  through a pluggable backend (`encode_json` / `mark_raw` / `materialize` /
  `render_named`), with an injectable JSON encoder. SSR output is unchanged for
  the Mojolicious path.

  Note for consumers that wire Perl `@INC` by hand: `BarefootJS.pm` now ships in
  `@barefootjs/perl/lib` rather than `@barefootjs/mojolicious/lib`. Point `@INC`
  at both package `lib/` directories (the Mojolicious integration's build does
  this automatically).

- 199644e: Add `@barefootjs/xslate` — a Text::Xslate (Kolon) adapter that compiles
  BarefootJS IR to `.tx` templates and ships `BarefootJS::Backend::Xslate`. Because
  the rendering backend is framework-agnostic, it runs under any PSGI/Plack app
  (no Mojolicious required). Validated end-to-end against Text::Xslate 3.5.9 and
  served live via Plack.

  The EP→Kolon mapping is mechanical (`<%= X %>` → `<: X :>`, `<%== X %>` →
  `<: X | mark_raw :>`, `bf->m` → `$bf.m()`), so the engine-agnostic
  `BarefootJS` runtime renders through Xslate unchanged.

  Also generalizes the core `render_child` (in `@barefootjs/perl`) to accept the
  single-hashref call form that Text::Xslate Kolon (and Template Toolkit) method
  calls require, in addition to the existing Mojo list form. Backward-compatible.

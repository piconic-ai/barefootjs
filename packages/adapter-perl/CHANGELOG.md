# @barefootjs/perl

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ac91bc6: Extract the engine-agnostic Perl runtime (`BarefootJS.pm`) into a new
  `@barefootjs/perl` package. `@barefootjs/mojolicious` now depends on it and
  keeps only the Mojo-specific pieces — `BarefootJS::Backend::Mojo`, the
  `Mojolicious::Plugin::BarefootJS` binding, and the compile-time adapter that
  emits Embedded Perl (`.html.ep`).

  The runtime is Mojo-free at load time and drives any Perl template engine
  through a pluggable backend (`encode_json` / `mark_raw` / `materialize` /
  `render_named`), with an injectable JSON encoder. SSR output is unchanged for
  the Mojolicious path.

  Note for consumers that wire Perl `@INC` by hand: `BarefootJS.pm` now ships in
  `@barefootjs/perl/lib` rather than `@barefootjs/mojolicious/lib`. Point `@INC`
  at both package `lib/` directories (the Mojolicious integration's build does
  this automatically).

- 199644e: Add `@barefootjs/xslate` — a Text::Xslate (Kolon) adapter that compiles
  BarefootJS IR to `.tx` templates and ships `BarefootJS::Backend::Xslate`. Because
  the rendering backend is framework-agnostic, it runs under any PSGI/Plack app
  (no Mojolicious required). Validated end-to-end against Text::Xslate 3.5.9 and
  served live via Plack.

  The EP→Kolon mapping is mechanical (`<%= X %>` → `<: X :>`, `<%== X %>` →
  `<: X | mark_raw :>`, `bf->m` → `$bf.m()`), so the engine-agnostic
  `BarefootJS` runtime renders through Xslate unchanged.

  Also generalizes the core `render_child` (in `@barefootjs/perl`) to accept the
  single-hashref call form that Text::Xslate Kolon (and Template Toolkit) method
  calls require, in addition to the existing Mojo list form. Backward-compatible.

/**
 * Fixtures that compile clean on this adapter but render divergent from the
 * Hono reference through the real `bf-render` minijinja binary. The
 * conformance `skipJsx` set and `packages/compat`'s published
 * fixture-divergences both derive from this one object, so the skip list
 * and the declaration can't drift. Keep the file even when the set is
 * empty — the next divergence lands here, not in a re-created file.
 * (`string-concat-plus` is NOT here — minijinja's `+` concatenates
 * strings, unlike Perl/PHP/Twig.)

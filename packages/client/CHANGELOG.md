- 8742059: Fix two follow-up issues from the #1663 dynamic-dispatch work.

  `__bfText` could render both a stale element and fresh text in a conditional slot: that path re-resolves the anchor via `$t()` each run, which inserts a new text node before an element left by a previous Node-valued run. Writing a primitive now clears any remaining siblings up to the end marker, so switching JSX → text leaves only the text.

  The no-arg props default (`= {}`) is now asserted to the param's annotated type (`= {} as T`) in both the test and Hono adapters. `hasRequiredProps` treats a prop with a destructuring default as non-required, but the declared props type may still mark that field required, so a bare `= {}` failed `tsc` ("Property 'x' is missing in type '{}'..."). The destructuring defaults still supply the values at runtime.

- 9dcffdf: Compile JSX used as an object-literal arrow value and render dynamic dispatch (#1663).

  A `Record<K, () => JSX>` lookup map (`{ piconic: () => <BrandLogo/> }`) was never lowered: a module-level map had its const dropped from the emitted module (`ReferenceError` at SSR), and a function-local map leaked raw `<...>` into the client bundle (`SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'`). The preprocessor now hoists arrow values in object-literal property assignments into synthesized components, the same lowering already applied to arrows in JSX-attribute position, so the lookup map survives as component references.

  Dynamic dispatch of such a map in child position (`<div>{themeLogo(props.id)}</div>`) now renders on the client: the dynamic-text effect routes through a new `__bfText` runtime helper that splices the live component element into the slot by identity instead of stringifying it to `"[object HTMLElement]"`. Adapters and `createComponent` default missing props to `{}` so a bare no-arg shim call (`LOGOS[id]()`) no longer crashes destructuring `undefined`.

- 113a17c: Reactive whole-item conditionals in loops (#1665).

  `arr.map(t => cond(t) && <li/>)` (and `cond ? <li/> : null`, `expr || <li/>`,
  `expr ?? <li/>`) makes the conditional the entire loop item, so an item renders
  0-or-1 element per pass. Previously this either threw at hydration (the loop's
  children stayed empty and the whole `.map(...)` was emitted verbatim as
  reactive text — uncompiled inline JSX, undeclared module-level helpers) or, once
  compiled, crashed at runtime (`firstElementChild.cloneNode` on a null element)
  or froze at its server-rendered value.

  This is now fully reactive, with identical behaviour whether the array is a
  `const` or a `signal()`:

  - **Runtime** — new `mapArrayAnchored` tracks each item by an always-present
    `<!--bf-loop-i:KEY-->` anchor comment (not a root element, which the item may
    not have); content lives between the anchor and the next anchor / loop end and
    is derived from the live DOM range each pass. `insert()` accepts the anchor as
    its scope so a whole-item conditional toggles range-scoped to its own item.
  - **Compiler** — detect the whole-item conditional, hoist the key from the
    rendering branch, emit per-item anchors plus a `mapArrayAnchored` renderItem;
    static-array bodies route through the same path. Logical (`&&`/`||`/`??`) and
    ternary JSX-helper map bodies are inlined, and BF023 now requires a key on
    those bodies.
  - **SSR adapters** — Hono, Go, and Mojo emit the per-item `bf-loop-i:KEY` anchor
    so server-rendered lists hydrate. Hono also emits `data-key` on the
    conditional branch's loop-item root, matching Go / CSR.

  Both-branch-element ternaries (`cond ? <A/> : <B/>`) render exactly one element
  and keep their existing `mapArray` path.

### Patch Changes

- b136f8d: Remove internal @barefootjs/\* from published devDependencies to avoid npm registry dependency graph pollution
- 7e9570d: Fix CSR `render()` dropping all but the first root of a multi-root (fragment) component. `render()` now mounts every root element; for the multi-root case it recreates the SSR fragment layout (a `bf-scope:` comment marker before the sibling roots) so `$c()` resolves sibling child scopes via the comment range. The async hydration walk no longer re-initializes a `render()`'d fragment scope — the comment-scope path now honours `hydratedScopes`, matching the element-scope path — so multi-root components mount every root and initialize exactly once.
- 44c3466: Fix two mapArray bugs (#1627):

  - Hydration now removes orphaned SSR nodes when the client signal has fewer items than the server rendered.
  - Components created via `createComponent` (the CSR path mapArray takes for new loop items post-hydration) now thread their own scope id into `_parentScopeId`, so child components rendered by `renderChild` get parent-prefixed `bf-s`/`bf-h`/`bf-m` markers. This lets the component's init resolve them via `$c(scope, 'sN')` and wire up event handlers, matching the SSR convention.

### Patch Changes

- 7bd1762: Decode JSX character references in Phase 1 and escape static content on emit. JSX defines `&copy;` in literal text (and in quoted attribute values) as the character `©` — Babel, esbuild, and TypeScript's JSX emit all decode at parse time — but the compiler carried the RAW source text through the IR, so every template adapter re-emitted the undecoded entity (`html-entity-text` divergence) and none escaped HTML metacharacters in static attribute values (`static-attr-escape`: `title="Fish & Chips"` reached the output unescaped). Phase 1 now decodes via the new `decodeEntities` (`@barefootjs/shared`; numeric references fully, named references from a curated table — unknown names degrade consistently on every backend), so `IRText.value` and static attribute values carry the semantics. Emission escapes per context: the eight template adapters and the client-JS `innerHTML` template builders route static text and attribute values through the shared `escapeHtml` (`& < > "`), and the Hono adapter re-encodes for JSX source (adding `{`/`}`). Both fixtures graduate from all eight adapters' `renderDivergences` declarations and from the CSR conformance skip list.

### Patch Changes

- 23cc4dc: Normalize intrinsic-element attribute names ONCE in Phase 1: `IRAttribute.name` now carries the HTML/SVG attribute name, so every adapter emits it verbatim. The shared `dom-prop` classifier grows an `HTML_CAMEL_ALIASES` table (React-style camelCase → HTML: `tabIndex` → `tabindex`, `maxLength` → `maxlength`, `autoComplete` → `autocomplete`, `readOnly` → the boolean `readonly`, `spellCheck` → the enumerated `spellcheck`, …) consulted by both `toHTMLAttrName` (now applied in `jsx-to-ir`'s `processAttributes`) and `toHTMLAttrNameRuntime` (spread paths). Previously each adapter mapped at most `className` → `class` itself and every other alias leaked into the emitted HTML as an unknown attribute the browser ignores — `htmlFor` never became `for` (broken label association on template backends), `readOnly` rendered as `readOnly="true"` vs bare presence depending on backend, and SVG `strokeWidth`/`strokeLinecap` passed through unmapped. Component props (`IRProp`) keep the user's API names; unknown names (`data-*`, custom-element attributes, `viewBox`-style case-sensitive SVG XML names) pass through unchanged. The `camelcase-attributes`, `svg-icon`, and `boolean-attr-literals` fixtures graduate from every adapter's `renderDivergences` declaration and the CSR skip list.

### Patch Changes

- c8c7d50: Recognize the `searchParams` env signal structurally via `createSearchParams()` (#2057, part 1).

  The request-scoped query env signal is now a `createSignal`-shaped factory the compiler recognizes by structure, removing the `searchParams` name allow-list from the compiler core:

  ```tsx
  // before
  import { searchParams } from "@barefootjs/client";
  searchParams().get("sort");

  // after
  import { createSearchParams } from "@barefootjs/client";
  const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = createSearchParams();
  searchParams().get("sort"); // reactive read
  setSearchParams({ sort: "price" }); // single imperative navigation path
  ```

  Because `searchParams` is now a real signal getter, it lands in the fold purity oracle and reactive-getter set structurally — the clean fix for the fold-oracle special-casing (superseding the reverted #2055) with no name allow-list.

  - `@barefootjs/client`: **breaking** — the bare `searchParams` export is replaced by `createSearchParams()`, which returns a `[getter, setter]` tuple. The getter is the request-scoped query reader (unchanged SSR + client resolution); `setSearchParams(next)` is the single imperative navigation path (soft same-route nav via the router seam, hard-nav fallback otherwise), replacing the confusing mutable-`URLSearchParams` write path. `SearchParamsInit` accepts a query string, `URLSearchParams`, or a record.
  - `@barefootjs/jsx`: `createSearchParams` is a recognized signal primitive tagged with an `envReader` key on `SignalInfo`; `CLIENT_EXPORTS` swaps `searchParams` for `createSearchParams`; env-signal recognition flows from IR structure, not import names. Codegen keeps env signals out of normal value/field emission while leaving them in the reactivity graph.
  - `@barefootjs/shared`: new `BF_SEAM_NAV_SEARCH` seam for imperative query navigation.
  - Adapters (`go-template`, `hono`, `mojolicious`, `xslate`): env-signal reader lowering keys off signal structure instead of the import name; the per-request reader binding (`bf.SearchParams` / `$searchParams`) is unchanged.

  Migration: replace `import { searchParams } from '@barefootjs/client'` + `searchParams()` with `import { createSearchParams } from '@barefootjs/client'` + `const [searchParams] = createSearchParams()`, and use `setSearchParams(...)` for imperative query navigation.

### Minor Changes

- 071a1a3: `<Region>` now lowers to a `bf-region` page-lifecycle boundary (spec/router.md), the smallest end-to-end proof for the router RFC's compiler-derived nested regions. Following the `<Async>` built-in precedent, the compiler recognises `<Region>` (and its self-closing form) by tag name and lowers it to a wrapper `<div>` carrying a deterministic `bf-region="<file scope>:<index>"` id — the `computeFileScope` FNV hash of the source path plus a per-file structural index. Because a layout compiles to one shared partial, every page composing it emits the _same_ id, which is what a client router matches a region on across page documents.

  The id is a static string, so all four adapters (Hono, Go template, Mojolicious, Xslate) emit byte-identical `bf-region="<id>"` markers — no per-adapter template interpolation. Covered by a cross-adapter conformance fixture (`region-boundary`) in addition to the Hono-only emit assertion in `packages/jsx`.

  Recognition is by capitalized tag name; import-scoped disambiguation, a runtime `<Region>` export, nested/sibling runtime diffing, and the scope-ownership dispose/rehydrate path are follow-ups.

### Minor Changes

- 07b95ad: Add the SR2 event collector and SR4 IR join for `bf debug profile` (#1690).

  - **`@barefootjs/shared`**: `ProfilerEvent` / `ProfilerEventType` — the
    normalized event wire contract shared by the runtime producer and the jsx
    consumer. It lives in `shared` (built first, depended on by both) so the
    jsx↔client peer relationship stays free of a build-order cycle.
  - **`@barefootjs/client`**: `createRecordingSink()` (SR2) — turns the raw
    `ProfilerEventSink` callbacks (SR1) into a flat, ordered, **turn-stamped**
    event log. It tracks the `beginTurn`/`endTurn` stack (SR3) and stamps every
    event with the handler id in scope, so per-turn metrics need no microtask
    guesswork.
  - **`@barefootjs/jsx`**: `buildIdIndex(graph)` + `joinProfilerEvents(events,
index)` (SR4) — resolve each event's compiler-assigned id to its source-mapped
    IR node (signals/memos/effects, including controlled-signal sync effects).
    Unresolved ids are surfaced as coverage gaps, never dropped (SR4 invariant).

  These are the substrate the v1 analyses (hot subscribers / wasted re-runs /
  batch advisor) consume next. Dev-only; no effect on production builds (SR8).

- 7079ca0: Count turn _invocations_, not handler ids, in profiler metrics (#1690).

  Dogfooding a list whose rows share one `onClick` revealed that firing the same
  handler N times (clicking N rows) collapsed into a single "turn" — because
  events were keyed by the handler-id string. That inflated `runsPerTurn` and
  batch-advisor savings (N interactions summed into one turn).

  `ProfilerEvent` now carries `turnSeq` (a unique per-invocation counter the
  recording sink stamps at each `beginTurn`). The analyses count distinct turns by
  `turnSeq`: hot-subscribers `runsPerTurn` divides by real invocations, the batch
  advisor evaluates each invocation separately (reporting the worst per handler),
  and `report.turns` reflects interactions while `coverage.handlersFired` still
  counts distinct handlers. A 3-row list now reads `turns: 3, handlers: 1/1`
  (was `turns: 1`).

- 1919a0c: Add the wasted-re-runs analysis — v1 (#1690, §4.2.2).

  A reactive effect/memo that re-ran but produced output identical to its
  previous run did removable work — the complement to hot subscribers (where the
  cost is, vs. how much of it is removable).

  - **Fingerprint (SR1, dev-only/SR8):** new optional `effectOutput(id, changed)`
    sink method on the SR2 stream. The runtime aggregates a per-run output verdict
    via `__bfReportOutput` (flushed once at run exit): memos compare the recomputed
    value by `Object.is`; text bindings (`__bfText`) compare the written string —
    and a stale-element cleanup counts as a real DOM change. A run with no
    fingerprint emits no event and isn't counted. `effectOutput` is optional on the
    exported `ProfilerEventSink`, so a pre-existing custom sink stays valid.
  - **Analysis (SR2 + SR4):** `analyzeWastedReReruns` / `formatWastedReReruns`,
    `wasted = wastedRuns / totalRuns`, joined to IR source loc and ranked by
    removable cost then ratio (deterministic). Surfaced in `buildProfileReport` /
    `formatProfileReport` (text + `--json`) behind the new `--wasted-pct` flag
    (default 50%).

### Patch Changes

- d87144d: Handle `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` arriving through a spread/rest object in the runtime spread helpers (follow-up to the explicit-attribute support in #1704). `classifyDOMProp` now classifies it as a dedicated `innerHTML` kind; `spreadAttrs` skips it (so a spread carrying it no longer serialises a bogus `dangerouslySetInnerHTML="[object Object]"` attribute), and `applyRestAttrs` assigns the raw `el.innerHTML = value.__html` (the escape hatch) instead of `setAttribute`.

### Patch Changes

- 113a17c: Reactive whole-item conditionals in loops (#1665).

  `arr.map(t => cond(t) && <li/>)` (and `cond ? <li/> : null`, `expr || <li/>`,
  `expr ?? <li/>`) makes the conditional the entire loop item, so an item renders
  0-or-1 element per pass. Previously this either threw at hydration (the loop's
  children stayed empty and the whole `.map(...)` was emitted verbatim as
  reactive text — uncompiled inline JSX, undeclared module-level helpers) or, once
  compiled, crashed at runtime (`firstElementChild.cloneNode` on a null element)
  or froze at its server-rendered value.

  This is now fully reactive, with identical behaviour whether the array is a
  `const` or a `signal()`:

  - **Runtime** — new `mapArrayAnchored` tracks each item by an always-present
    `<!--bf-loop-i:KEY-->` anchor comment (not a root element, which the item may
    not have); content lives between the anchor and the next anchor / loop end and
    is derived from the live DOM range each pass. `insert()` accepts the anchor as
    its scope so a whole-item conditional toggles range-scoped to its own item.
  - **Compiler** — detect the whole-item conditional, hoist the key from the
    rendering branch, emit per-item anchors plus a `mapArrayAnchored` renderItem;
    static-array bodies route through the same path. Logical (`&&`/`||`/`??`) and
    ternary JSX-helper map bodies are inlined, and BF023 now requires a key on
    those bodies.
  - **SSR adapters** — Hono, Go, and Mojo emit the per-item `bf-loop-i:KEY` anchor
    so server-rendered lists hydrate. Hono also emits `data-key` on the
    conditional branch's loop-item root, matching Go / CSR.

  Both-branch-element ternaries (`cond ? <A/> : <B/>`) render exactly one element
  and keep their existing `mapArray` path.

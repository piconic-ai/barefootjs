### Patch Changes

- d87144d: Handle `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` arriving through a spread/rest object in the runtime spread helpers (follow-up to the explicit-attribute support in #1704). `classifyDOMProp` now classifies it as a dedicated `innerHTML` kind; `spreadAttrs` skips it (so a spread carrying it no longer serialises a bogus `dangerouslySetInnerHTML="[object Object]"` attribute), and `applyRestAttrs` assigns the raw `el.innerHTML = value.__html` (the escape hatch) instead of `setAttribute`.

### Patch Changes

- 113a17c: Reactive whole-item conditionals in loops (#1665).

  `arr.map(t => cond(t) && <li/>)` (and `cond ? <li/> : null`, `expr || <li/>`,
  `expr ?? <li/>`) makes the conditional the entire loop item, so an item renders
  0-or-1 element per pass. Previously this either threw at hydration (the loop's
  children stayed empty and the whole `.map(...)` was emitted verbatim as
  reactive text — uncompiled inline JSX, undeclared module-level helpers) or, once
  compiled, crashed at runtime (`firstElementChild.cloneNode` on a null element)
  or froze at its server-rendered value.

  This is now fully reactive, with identical behaviour whether the array is a
  `const` or a `signal()`:

  - **Runtime** — new `mapArrayAnchored` tracks each item by an always-present
    `<!--bf-loop-i:KEY-->` anchor comment (not a root element, which the item may
    not have); content lives between the anchor and the next anchor / loop end and
    is derived from the live DOM range each pass. `insert()` accepts the anchor as
    its scope so a whole-item conditional toggles range-scoped to its own item.
  - **Compiler** — detect the whole-item conditional, hoist the key from the
    rendering branch, emit per-item anchors plus a `mapArrayAnchored` renderItem;
    static-array bodies route through the same path. Logical (`&&`/`||`/`??`) and
    ternary JSX-helper map bodies are inlined, and BF023 now requires a key on
    those bodies.
  - **SSR adapters** — Hono, Go, and Mojo emit the per-item `bf-loop-i:KEY` anchor
    so server-rendered lists hydrate. Hono also emits `data-key` on the
    conditional branch's loop-item root, matching Go / CSR.

  Both-branch-element ternaries (`cond ? <A/> : <B/>`) render exactly one element
  and keep their existing `mapArray` path.

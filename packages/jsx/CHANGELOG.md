### Patch Changes

- ad11fb8: Fix a nested child component being dropped during hydration when a static sibling element precedes a `.map()` inside a component (or fragment / provider / async) container (#1688). `computeLoopSiblingOffsets` only counted preceding DOM siblings under element parents, so a loop nested directly inside such a container got a silently-zero `siblingOffset`. The generated `container.children[__idx]` lookup for each item's nested child was then off by one, resolving the first item's child against the static sibling and dropping it. Sibling counting now runs for every container whose children render as a contiguous run of DOM siblings.
- 562d343: Bake typed and scalar signal array-literal initial values into the generated `NewXxxProps` SSR data context, so Go server-renders the initial loop items instead of an empty list (#1672). Untyped object arrays and non-literal initialisers continue to default to `nil`.

  `TypeDefinition` now carries structured `properties` (`PropertyInfo[]`) for object/interface types, so adapters can consume a type's field set without re-parsing its source text. The go-template adapter uses this to derive struct fields and bake object literals against the real field set.

- dff7704: Raise BF101 at build time for unsupported `String.prototype` methods on the template-language adapters (#1448 follow-up).

  Methods that have no SSR lowering — `split`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, `replace`, `replaceAll`, `repeat`, `padStart`, `padEnd`, `charAt`, `charCodeAt`, `codePointAt`, `normalize`, `substring`, `substr`, `match`, `matchAll`, `search` — were previously absent from the `UNSUPPORTED_METHODS` gate, so `isSupported` reported them supported and the Go / Mojolicious adapters emitted an invalid raw method call (`{{.Name.StartsWith "a"}}` / `$name->{startsWith}('a')`) that produced no build diagnostic and only crashed at template-render time.

  They now surface BF101 with an actionable `/* @client */` suggestion (parity with the unsupported array methods), and the adapter degrades to a safe empty slot instead of emitting template that fails at render. The Mojo adapter routes these through the AST path so the shared `isSupported` gate fires rather than the regex pipeline mangling them. The `/* @client */` escape hatch continues to work for any of these expressions.

### Patch Changes

- 8742059: Fix two follow-up issues from the #1663 dynamic-dispatch work.

  `__bfText` could render both a stale element and fresh text in a conditional slot: that path re-resolves the anchor via `$t()` each run, which inserts a new text node before an element left by a previous Node-valued run. Writing a primitive now clears any remaining siblings up to the end marker, so switching JSX → text leaves only the text.

  The no-arg props default (`= {}`) is now asserted to the param's annotated type (`= {} as T`) in both the test and Hono adapters. `hasRequiredProps` treats a prop with a destructuring default as non-required, but the declared props type may still mark that field required, so a bare `= {}` failed `tsc` ("Property 'x' is missing in type '{}'..."). The destructuring defaults still supply the values at runtime.

- 9dcffdf: Compile JSX used as an object-literal arrow value and render dynamic dispatch (#1663).

  A `Record<K, () => JSX>` lookup map (`{ piconic: () => <BrandLogo/> }`) was never lowered: a module-level map had its const dropped from the emitted module (`ReferenceError` at SSR), and a function-local map leaked raw `<...>` into the client bundle (`SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'`). The preprocessor now hoists arrow values in object-literal property assignments into synthesized components, the same lowering already applied to arrows in JSX-attribute position, so the lookup map survives as component references.

  Dynamic dispatch of such a map in child position (`<div>{themeLogo(props.id)}</div>`) now renders on the client: the dynamic-text effect routes through a new `__bfText` runtime helper that splices the live component element into the slot by identity instead of stringifying it to `"[object HTMLElement]"`. Adapters and `createComponent` default missing props to `{}` so a bare no-arg shim call (`LOGOS[id]()`) no longer crashes destructuring `undefined`.

- 5d49015: Per-item attribute reading an outer signal by index now becomes reactive inside `.map()` (#1673).

  A per-item attribute/style expression inside a keyed `.map()` only got a `createEffect` when it read the loop item accessor (`it.w`) or a directly-named signal/memo/prop. If it instead read the source array signal through a helper indexed by position — e.g. `style={`width:${widthAt(i)}%`}` where `const widthAt = (i) => items()[i].w` — the compiler emitted no reactive effect and the value froze at its server-rendered value after hydration. The identical binding on a top-level element updated correctly.

  `collectLoopChildReactiveAttrs` now applies the same Solid-style wrap-by-default AST-flag fallback (`callsReactiveGetters` / `hasFunctionCalls`) that the top-level attribute path (`decideWrapForAttr`, #940) already used. An opaque function call inside a per-item attribute is wrapped in a per-item `createEffect`, so it tracks whatever signals it reads at runtime and reflects current state after hydration — matching the equivalent top-level binding. The emitted effect resolves the loop index reference to the renderItem index variable, so the closure stays valid.

- 113a17c: Reactive whole-item conditionals in loops (#1665).

  `arr.map(t => cond(t) && <li/>)` (and `cond ? <li/> : null`, `expr || <li/>`,
  `expr ?? <li/>`) makes the conditional the entire loop item, so an item renders
  0-or-1 element per pass. Previously this either threw at hydration (the loop's
  children stayed empty and the whole `.map(...)` was emitted verbatim as
  reactive text — uncompiled inline JSX, undeclared module-level helpers) or, once
  compiled, crashed at runtime (`firstElementChild.cloneNode` on a null element)
  or froze at its server-rendered value.

  This is now fully reactive, with identical behaviour whether the array is a
  `const` or a `signal()`:

  - **Runtime** — new `mapArrayAnchored` tracks each item by an always-present
    `<!--bf-loop-i:KEY-->` anchor comment (not a root element, which the item may
    not have); content lives between the anchor and the next anchor / loop end and
    is derived from the live DOM range each pass. `insert()` accepts the anchor as
    its scope so a whole-item conditional toggles range-scoped to its own item.
  - **Compiler** — detect the whole-item conditional, hoist the key from the
    rendering branch, emit per-item anchors plus a `mapArrayAnchored` renderItem;
    static-array bodies route through the same path. Logical (`&&`/`||`/`??`) and
    ternary JSX-helper map bodies are inlined, and BF023 now requires a key on
    those bodies.
  - **SSR adapters** — Hono, Go, and Mojo emit the per-item `bf-loop-i:KEY` anchor
    so server-rendered lists hydrate. Hono also emits `data-key` on the
    conditional branch's loop-item root, matching Go / CSR.

  Both-branch-element ternaries (`cond ? <A/> : <B/>`) render exactly one element
  and keep their existing `mapArray` path.

## 0.5.0

### Patch Changes

- 5cf7272: Emit `barefoot-importmap.html` for template-string adapters (#1644).

  Follow-up to #1639/#1641. The externals system writes `barefoot-externals.json`
  for every adapter, but the Go html/template and Mojolicious adapters had no
  equivalent of Hono's `BfImportMap` component, so a project configuring
  `externals` there had nowhere to inject the importmap + preloads.

  - `bf build` now emits a ready-to-include `barefoot-importmap.html` snippet
    (generated from the same manifest) alongside `barefoot-externals.json` for
    template-string adapters. Include it via `{{ template "barefoot-importmap.html" . }}`
    (Go) or `%= include 'barefoot-importmap'` (Mojolicious).
  - Add `TemplateAdapter.importMapInjection` (`'component' | 'html-snippet'`) so an
    adapter declares how it exposes the importmap. Hono is `'component'` (no
    snippet emitted); Go/Mojo are `'html-snippet'`.
  - New `renderImportMapHtml` + `ExternalsManifest` exports from `@barefootjs/jsx`
    (and a zero-dependency `@barefootjs/jsx/import-map` subpath) are the single
    source of truth for the snippet HTML. Hono's `BfImportMap` now delegates to it
    so the component and snippet paths cannot drift — the snippet inherits Hono's
    `crossorigin` modulepreload fix (#1648) and the `<`-escaped importmap JSON.
  - New cross-adapter `assertImportMapInjectionContract` in `@barefootjs/adapter-tests`
    fails if a new adapter ships without an importmap injection point, and now also
    asserts parity: the external must resolve _through_ the importmap and every
    `modulepreload` hint must carry `crossorigin`.

- cbed3cc: Fix duplicate `__compEl` declaration when a nested `.map()` returns multiple child components (#1664).

  An outer `.map()` whose callback returns a wrapping element containing a nested `.map()` that emits more than one child component compiled all of them into a single shared inner `forEach` body. The emitter declared `const __compEl` once per component in that scope, producing a duplicate `const` declaration that threw `SyntaxError: Identifier '__compEl' has already been declared` at hydration. Each binding is now uniquely suffixed (`__compEl0`, `__compEl1`, …) when multiple components share the inner-loop scope; the single-component case keeps the plain `__compEl` name.

- 909b17a: Make `tokenContainsIdent` regex-literal aware (#1370).

  `scanForIdentifiers` (behind `tokenContainsIdent`) was the last hand-rolled
  char-by-char string-state machine outside the shared `ts.createScanner`
  lexer. It tracked quotes, template literals, and comments by hand but was
  blind to regex literals, so a lone quote inside a regex (`/it's/`) flipped it
  into string state and swallowed real identifier references, and an identifier
  inside a regex body (`/className/`) was wrongly counted as a reference.

  It now delegates to the shared `iterateJsTokens` lexer, which recognises
  regex literals, nested template literals, and comments in one place. Prop
  dependency detection on synthesised expression strings is now correct for
  expressions containing regex literals. No change to adapter output for
  existing fixtures.

- d13dc5c: Widen `.sort()` / `.toSorted()` comparator lowering with multi-key, relational-ternary, and block-body shapes (#1448 Tier B follow-up).

  The comparator parser now builds a structured `SortComparator` as a `keys: SortKey[]` list and accepts three previously-refused shapes (each lowering to both template-language adapters + the Hono/CSR JS path):

  - **Multi-key (`||`-chain)** — `(a, b) => a.x - b.x || a.y.localeCompare(b.y)` splits into one comparison key per `||` operand, applied in priority order as tie-breaks. Emits one 4-string `bf_sort` group (Go) / one `keys` hash (Mojo) per key.
  - **Relational ternary** — `(a, b) => a.f > b.f ? 1 : -1`, the 3-way `a.f < b.f ? -1 : a.f > b.f ? 1 : 0`, and the leading-tie `a.f === b.f ? 0 : …` forms lower to a new `auto` compare type: numeric when both keys parse as numbers, else lexical. Both template runtimes share this rule so their output stays byte-equal (diverges from JS `<`/`>` only for numeric strings).
  - **Single-`return` block bodies** — `(a, b) => { return a.f - b.f }` (arrow form; the function-expression form already worked) unwrap to the returned comparator.

  Runtime: Go `bf_sort` is now variadic over 4-string key groups with an `auto` branch; Mojo `bf->sort` takes an ordered `keys` list with the same `auto` rule. Function-reference comparators (`sort(myCmp)`), multi-statement block bodies, and `localeCompare(b, locale, opts)` stay refused (BF021) — deferred follow-ups.

- 6326d07: Unify the importmap manifest type across the component and snippet paths.

  Both importmap injection paths now describe `barefoot-externals.json` with one
  type. `@barefootjs/jsx` exports a shared `ImportMapManifest` (the optional-field
  subset the renderer needs); `renderImportMapHtml` takes it, and the strict build
  output `ExternalsManifest` remains its all-required superset.

  **Breaking (`@barefootjs/hono`):** the `BarefootExternalsManifest` type export is
  removed. Type a `BfImportMap` `externals` prop with `ImportMapManifest` from
  `@barefootjs/jsx` instead (the runtime prop shape is unchanged, so importing the
  parsed `barefoot-externals.json` and passing it through still works).

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 2d817a0: Fix the client `hydrate` template lambda mishandling auto-deferred conditionals that read per-instance `createForm` state (`{field.error() && …}`). The module-scope template can't reproduce `createForm`, so it emitted `undefined.field(...)` (throws) or re-inlined a throwaway `createForm({...})`. It now emits empty `bf-cond-start`/`bf-cond-end` markers like SSR and lets `init`'s `insert()` populate the branch, fixing client-render (`createComponent`) of `@barefootjs/form` components.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0111b70: Add source locations/JSX previews to DOM bindings, `bf debug loops`, `bf debug why-update`, `bf debug summary` commands, and improved `bf debug fallbacks` output
- 210563a: Resolve event handler setters transitively through helper-function call chains. BREAKING: SetterRef.via and WhyUpdateSource.via are now string[] (the call chain) instead of string.

### Patch Changes

- 52a511d: Resolve event handler setters through arrow-function consts (not just function declarations) in setter analysis
- ea37bfc: Auto-defer reactive brand-package bindings (e.g. `@barefootjs/form` field accessors) referenced from template positions instead of raising BF061. `value={field.value()}`, `disabled={form.isSubmitting()}`, and `{field.error() && …}` now compile without a manual `/* @client */` on each binding.
- d64f94b: Add EventHandler wiring to TestNode: onClick, onInput, onChange, onSubmit shorthands and on() fallback
  - @barefootjs/shared@0.3.0

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 91523ba: Add .findLast(p) / .findLastIndex(p) higher-order method lowering (#1448 Tier B). Go template adapter lowers via bf_find_last / bf_find_last_index runtime helpers (equality predicates) and range-based template blocks (complex predicates). Mojo adapter refuses with BF101 (matching existing find/findIndex gap).
- a5a466c: Compile props.X.map() to mapArray for reactive DOM reconciliation instead of static forEach (#1586). Direct prop array references in .map() expressions are now treated as potentially reactive, consistent with the compiler's existing "props are always reactive" design.
- a57e113: Unify inner-loop reactive-attribute emit through the centralised emitAttrUpdate helper (#1368). Fixes boolean-attr handling in nested loops (now uses DOM property assignment) and adds missing className/value special-case handling.

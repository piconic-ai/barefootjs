### Patch Changes

- 31372ca: Declare two build-time refusal contracts in every template adapter's conformance-pins set, surfaced by the Priority-12 edge-case conformance sweep: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (raw-HTML output needs a deliberate per-template-language affordance; the compiler already refuses the shape with BF101) and `String.prototype.replaceAll` (only first-occurrence `.replace` is wired to the runtime helpers; already refused with BF101 rather than silently reusing the first-only lowering). Test-contract metadata only — no adapter runtime or codegen behavior changes; the pins make the pre-existing refusals part of each adapter's asserted conformance surface (and visible to `bf compat`).
- 4c722c8: Publish each template adapter's render-level conformance divergences as a machine-readable `renderDivergences` export (new `RenderDivergences` type in `@barefootjs/jsx`) — the render-level sibling of `conformancePins`. The Priority-12 edge-case sweep (#2168) skipped fixtures that render differently from the Hono reference via per-test-file `skipJsx` literals, which made the docs compatibility matrix look all-green while divergences were only visible in test-file comments. Each adapter now declares those fixtures (with a one-line rationale) in `src/render-divergences.ts`; its conformance suite derives `skipJsx` from the same object so the published declaration and the test skips cannot drift, and `packages/compat` publishes both pins and render divergences in a new `fixtureDivergences` section of `ui/compat.lock.json`, rendered honestly on the docs compatibility-matrix page. No adapter runtime or codegen behavior changes.

### Minor Changes

- 17dfdf8: New PHP backend adapter targeting Laravel Blade. `BladeAdapter` ports the Twig adapter's IR lowering to Blade syntax (`{!! e(…) !!}` / `@if` / `@elseif` / `@foreach`), and the package bundles a PHP runtime backend (`packages/adapter-blade/php/`) built on `illuminate/view` standalone (Filesystem + Dispatcher + EngineResolver/BladeCompiler + FileViewFinder + Factory) — a `BladeBackend` implementing the engine backend contract (`encode_json`, `mark_raw`, `materialize`, `render_named`, `ident`) on top of the shared engine-agnostic runtime (`@barefootjs/php`). Templates call the same snake_case `bf.<helper>` surface as the other PHP/Perl/Python adapters, with `bf.truthy` / `bf.eq` / `bf.neq` covering JS-vs-PHP semantic divergences (PHP truthiness, and PHP's `==`/`===` not matching JS strict equality).
